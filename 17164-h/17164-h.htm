<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The task of the Editor of these volumes has
been principally one of arrangement and compression.
The late lamented Mr. James Richardson
left behind him a copious journal, comprised
in eight small but closely-written volumes, besides
a vast heap of despatches and scattered
memoranda; and, at first sight, it seemed to
me that it would be necessary to melt the whole
down into a narrative in the third person. On
attentively studying the materials before me,
however, I perceived that Mr. Richardson had
written in most places with a view to publication;
and that, had he lived, he would soon
have brought what, on a cursory examination,
appeared a mere chaotic mass, into a shape
that would have accorded with his own idea
of a book of travels. Such being the case, I
thought it best&mdash;in order to leave the stamp of<a name="pagevi" id="pagevi"></a><span class="pageno">[vi]</span>
authenticity on this singular record of enterprise&mdash;to
do little more than the author would himself
have done. In the form of a diary, therefore&mdash;written
sometimes with Oriental <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>&mdash;the
reader will here find what may be called the
domestic history of one of the most successful
expeditions undertaken for the exploration of
Central Africa. I believe it would have been
possible to get up a work of more temporary
interest from the same materials; but this could
only have been done by sacrificing truthfulness
of detail. In the present form, Mr. Richardson's
journal will always remain as an authority on
the geography and present condition of a large
portion of the Saharan desert, hitherto unvisited,
at any rate undescribed.</p>

<p>As will be seen, the Mission was accompanied
by two German gentlemen, Drs. Barth and Overweg&mdash;the
former, of whom I had the pleasure of
meeting in Egypt, after his enterprising ride
along the coast of Libya. They are still in
Central Africa, pushing their excursions on all
sides, from Bornou into unknown tracts; and
the accounts they may publish on their return
will be anxiously looked for. The great traverse
of the Saharan desert, however, with all its vicissitudes<a name="pagevii" id="pagevii"></a><span class="pageno">[vii]</span>
and dangers, the physical aspect of that
wonderful region, and the manners of the various
tribes that inhabit it, will, in the present volume,
be found to be fully described&mdash;not, it is true,
with much attempt at literary ornament, but in
the vivid though simple language in which a
man sets down impressions which he has just
received. I have endeavoured to remove all the
faults which may be supposed to have arisen
from haste or carelessness, and have necessarily
re-written several passages, and passed a correcting
pen over the whole manuscript. But I think
I may say with confidence, that there is no observation
or statement in the following pages which
cannot be justified by a reference to the original
journals and scattered memoranda.</p>

<p>To me this simple record of daily occurrences
seems highly interesting. It divides
itself, naturally, into a succession of parts of
unequal importance. First comes an account
of the journey to Mourzuk, the capital of Fezzan,
containing the traverse of the frightful Hamadah
or plateau which separates that province from
the regency of Tripoli. Then we have a residence
at Mourzuk itself, Mr. Richardson being
obliged to wait the arrival from Gh&acirc;t of an<a name="pageviii" id="pageviii"></a><span class="pageno">[viii]</span>
escort of Tuarick chieftains, with whom he had
partly made acquaintance during a former trip
in the desert. This escort appeared after some
delay; and the Mission proceeded across the
Fezzan plains to the independent state of Gh&acirc;t,
through a very wild and picturesque country.
At this point began, if not the most arduous, at
any rate the most dangerous, and at the same
time the most novel, part of the journey. Mr.
Richardson had undertaken, on his way to Soudan
Proper (his first destination), to pass by the
hitherto unexplored kingdom of Aheer or Asben,
situated towards the southern limits of the Sahara.
The march of the Mission across the
deserts that lie between Gh&acirc;t and that territory
was rendered exciting by continual reports of
danger from pursuing freebooters of the Haghar
and Azgher tribes; but the enemy were outstripped,
and no actual attack took place until
the first inhabited districts of Aheer were reached.
Here some lawless tribes levied black-mail,
on the caravan, which was then permitted to
proceed, though in doubt and alarm, until it
arrived under the long-expected protection of
Sheikh En-Noor, one of the great chiefs of the
Kailouee tribes, at his town, or rather encampment,<a name="pageix" id="pageix"></a><span class="pageno">[ix]</span>
of Tintalous. Mr. Richardson's residence
at this place was long and tedious. He suffered,
besides, from the extortionate disposition of the
Sheikh or Sultan, who, however, after considerable
exactions, became his friend. This Saharan
character is brought out by a succession of
amusing touches. But our traveller was impatient
to proceed, and seems to have hailed
with delight the announcement that the great
Salt-Caravan, which annually transports the necessary
condiment from Bilma <i>vi&acirc;</i> Aheer to
the south, was about to start, and that the
Sheikh and the Christians were to accompany
it. Some further disappointments occurred,
but at length the Mission proceeded to Damerghou,
whence Drs. Barth and Overweg went,
one to Maradee and the other to Kanou, whilst
Mr. Richardson proceeded alone to Zinder,
situated in the province of Damagram. Here
he was well received by the Sarkee, or Governor,
and he dilates with well-founded exultation
on his escape from the insolent and
rapacious Tuaricks. Sad sights, however, connected
with the slave-trade, checked his delight.
During his stay the Sarkee went out in person
to hunt down the subjects of his own sovereign,<a name="pagex" id="pagex"></a><span class="pageno">[x]</span>
that he might pay his debts by selling them
into captivity. After another considerable delay
Mr. Richardson was enabled to start once more,
and being obliged to change his original plan
proceeded to Kuka, the capital of Bornou, by
way of Minyo. Shortly after leaving Gurai,
the chief town of that province, the unfortunate
traveller found his strength to be gradually
giving way. He had already previously
complained of the heat and fatigue, but did
not seem to have felt any great alarm. Now,
however, the climate seems to have told upon
him with sudden and fatal violence. His last
moments are described in a letter from his
fellow-traveller, Dr. Barth, who hastened to the
spot with laudable energy as soon as he heard
of the melancholy catastrophe that had taken
place. Mr. Richardson died at Ungurutua,
about six days' journey from Kuka, the capital
of Bornou, on the 4th of March, 1851, eleven
months after his departure from Tripoli.</p>

<p>I have observed that the Mission, the first
transactions of which are described in these
volumes, is entitled to be called successful.
Although the original promoter and director
died just as he was on the point of reaching<a name="pagexi" id="pagexi"></a><span class="pageno">[xi]</span>
the termination of his journey, his enterprising
companions, Drs. Barth and Overweg,
seem to have carried on and developed admirably
the plan at first laid down. If they
be spared to return to Europe they will bring
home, no doubt, geographical information so
valuable that all Mr. Richardson's predictions
will be found to be amply fulfilled. As it is,
however, the object of our practical fellow-countryman
may be said to have been accomplished.
He did not lay so much stress on the accurate
determination of latitude and longitude, of the
heights of mountains and the courses of valleys,
as on matters that come more nearly home to
human sympathies. The abolition of the system
of slavery&mdash;many affecting illustrations of which
will be found in these volumes&mdash;seems to have
engaged the chief of his attention. It was with
this benevolent object that he originally turned
his attention to Africa; and he had become convinced
that the best means of effecting it was to
encourage legitimate traffic between Europe and
the great nurseries of slaves. Among other
things, he wished to show the possibility of entering
into treaties of amity and commerce with the
most important states of Central Africa; and<a name="pagexii" id="pagexii"></a><span class="pageno">[xii]</span>
although these treaties may not turn out to be
of great immediate utility, it is always worth
while that future explorers should know, that
on the borders of Lake Tchad there is a power
which professes to be united with England in
formal ties of friendship, and that the Sultan
of Bornou has never shown any disposition to
break his promises or secede from his engagements.
As to the question, whether legitimate
commerce can advantageously be carried on
across the Sahara, and substituted for the
frightful traffic in human beings, I do not
consider that it is as yet decided; but Mr.
Richardson's researches will throw great light
on this interesting subject.</p>

<p>I do not intend here to attempt an account
of the services rendered by Mr. Richardson to
the sciences of geography and ethnography during
his useful career. At some future period, no
doubt, this task will be performed; and it will
not fail to be added, that he was always impelled
by a higher motive than the mere satisfaction
of curiosity or ambition. A profound
conviction that something might be done towards
ameliorating the condition of the African
nations, if we were only better acquainted with<a name="pagexiii" id="pagexiii"></a><span class="pageno">[xiii]</span>
them, seems to have early possessed him. This
it was that sustained and guided his footsteps;
and all who knew him unite in testifying that
he concealed beneath a pleasant, cheerful exterior,
the character of a Christian gentleman,
and an ardent crusader against the worst form
of oppression which has ever been put in practice.
The hope that the public will unite in
this opinion must certainly assist in consoling
his widow for the loss which she has sustained.
Mrs. Richardson is alluded to in the narrative
throughout. It is necessary, therefore, to say,
that that lady remained in Tripoli until the news
of her bereavement reached her, and that she
then returned to England to promote the erection
of this best monument to her husband's memory.</p>

<p>I have now only to add an account written
by Dr. Barth (dated April 3, 1851) of the
death of Mr. Richardson, in a letter addressed
to Mr. Crowe, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General
at Tripoli. The German traveller,
as will be seen in the second volume of
this work, had separated from his English
companions on the plains of Damerghou, and
proceeded to prosecute other researches, the
results of which will be looked for with great
interest:&mdash;<a name="pagexiv" id="pagexiv"></a><span class="pageno">[xiv]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was on the 25th of March," he says, "that I
heard accidentally from a Shereef, whom I met on the
road, the sad news that my companion had died, about
twenty days before, in a place called Ungurutua, six days'
journey before reaching Kuka, when I hurried on as
fast as my horse would allow in order to secure his
papers and effects from being lost or destroyed.</p>

<p>"I now shall send you a short account of Mr.
Richardson's death, as far as I was able to make out
the circumstances from his servant. Mr. Richardson
is said to have left Zinder in the best health, though it
is probable that he felt already very weak while he was
there: for, according to the man whom he hired in
Zinder as his dragoman, he had, while there, a dream
that a bird came down from the sky, and when sitting
on the branch of a tree, the branch broke off and the
bird fell down to the earth. Mr. Richardson being very
much affected by this dream, went to a man who from a
huge book explains to the people their dreams. On
the man's telling him that his dream meant death, he
seems really to have anticipated that he would not reach
the principal object of his journey. But, nevertheless, he
seemed to be quite well, mounting even the horse
which the Governor of Zinder had made him a present
of, as far as Minyo, when he begged the Governor to
give him a camel, which he mounted thenceforward.
He felt notoriously ill in Kadalebria, eleven or twelve
days' journey from here (Kuka); and he is said by his
servant to have taken different kinds of medicines, one
after the other: from which you may conclude that he<a name="pagexv" id="pagexv"></a><span class="pageno">[xv]</span>
did not know himself what was his illness. Mr.
Richardson never could bear the sun, and the sun being
very powerful at this time of the year, it must have
affected him very much. I think this to be the chief
reason of his death; at least, he seems not to have had
a regular fever. He was happy to reach the large town
of Rangarvia after a journey of three short days, and
had the intention of returning from here directly to
Tripoli, without touching at Kuka and the low, hot
plain of Bornou, which he was affrightened of very
much. He offered two hundred mahboubs for a guide
to conduct him directly to the road to Bilma; but there
being no road from here, and no guide having been
found, it was necessary first to go to Kuka.</p>

<p>"Mr. Richardson, therefore, seems to have taken
strong medicines; in consequence of which, in the evening
of the third day of their halt at Rangarvia, after
having taken a walk through the town, he felt well enough
to fix his outset for the next morning. But this day being
rather a long one, and the sun being very powerful, he
became very tired and unwell; and the more so as, notwithstanding
his illness, he had not left off drinking
milk, even on his camel, mixing some brandy with it.
Having recovered a little during the night, he moved on
the next morning, but ordered a halt about noon, on
account of his weakness. Having started again at sunset,
they encamped at midnight. The next day, after
a short journey, they reached the Wady Mettaka. Mr.
Richardson seemed to feel much better, and drank milk
and a little jura, besides rice. From this place, on the last<a name="pagexvi" id="pagexvi"></a><span class="pageno">[xvi]</span>
day of Kebia-el-awel, the caravan, after but a two-hours'
march, reached the village called Ungurutua, when Mr.
Richardson soon felt so weak that he anticipated his
death; and leaving the hut (where he was established) for
his tent, told his dragoman, Mahommed Bu Saad, that he
would die. Being consoled by him that his illness was of
no consequence, he assured him several times that he had
no strength at all; and indeed his pulse ceased almost
to beat. He began, then, to rub his feet with vinegar,
and applied the same several times to his head and
shoulders. After which, in the absence of his servants,
he poured water also over himself; so that, when they
returned after a few moments, they found him quite
wet. To counteract the bad effect of this proceeding,
they began to rub him with a little oil. In the evening
he took a little food, and tried to sleep; but notwithstanding
that he seems to have taken something to
bring on sleep, he threw himself restless from one side
to the other, calling his wife several times by her
name. After having walked out of his tent with the
assistance of his servant, he ordered tea, and remained
restless on his bed. When it was past midnight, his old
dragoman, Yusuf Moknee, who watched in his tent,
made some coffee, in order to keep himself awake; upon
which Mr. Richardson demanded a cup of coffee for
himself; but his hand being so weak that he could
scarcely raise the cup, he said to Moknee: '<i>Tergamento
Ufa</i>,'&mdash;'Your office as dragoman is finished;' and repeated
several times, with a broken voice, '<i>Forza mafishe,
forza mafishe le-koul</i>,'&mdash;'I have no strength, I<a name="pagexvii" id="pagexvii"></a><span class="pageno">[xvii]</span>
have no strength, I tell you,' at the same time laying
Mahommed's hand on his shoulder. Feeling death
approaching, he got up in a sitting posture, being supported
by Mahommed, and soon expired, after three
times deep breathing. He was entirely worn out, and
died quietly, about two after midnight, Tuesday, 4th
March (Jumed-el-awel), without the least struggle.
His servant then called into the tent the other people
and the Kashalla, or officer of the Sheikh, who had
come along with them from Zinder, in order to be
witness, and while wrapping the body of the deceased in
three shirts which they had cut up, ordered the people
of the village to dig a grave for him. They then shut
up whatever of the luggage of Mr. Richardson was not
locked up, and prepared everything for their journey to
Kuka. Early in the morning they lifted the body,
wrapped up as it was, upon Mr. Richardson's carpet,
and carried him to his grave, which had been dug in
the shade of a large gaw, close to the village, to the
depth of four feet. Having then covered his head and
breast with a very large tabah, so as to protect it from
every side, they covered the body with earth, and had
the grave well secured. I have spoken several times
with Haj Beshir that it might be well taken care of,
and I am sure the grave of the traveller, who sacrificed
his life for his great object, will be respected. I send
you with this first kafila all Mr. Richardson's papers
and his journal, which is kept till the 21st February,
consisting of six reams, and his vocabularies, not
finished, four reams, with Yusuf's journal, as well as<a name="pagexviii" id="pagexviii"></a><span class="pageno">[xviii]</span>
all his other papers or letters. I have taken out only
the letters of recommendation of the Mission and the
papers concerning the treaty to be made, as well as a
letter from Lousou, one of the Tuaricks, and another
from Ibrahim, the Governor of Zinder, to the Queen,
which I shall enclose in my report to Government. I
send you, besides, an authentic list of all the objects
found in Mr. Richardson's possession, as it has been
made up on the things being deposited with Haj
Beshir.</p>

<p>"I beg you to assure Mrs. Richardson of my most
sincere sympathy, and that I hope she will find a good
deal of consolation in the rich journal of the deceased."</p></div>

<p>I have given the above narrative in the
words of Dr. Barth; but must direct the
reader's attention to vol. ii. p. 261, where he
will find that the whole account of the prophetic
dream is distorted by the very unauthentic
medium of Oriental report. There is
no reason to suppose that Mr. Richardson was
unusually affected by this circumstance, although
any dismal suggestion is likely to disturb a
person of sensibility placed in a dangerous position.
The remaining facts, as they seem confirmed
by concurrent testimony, may be taken
as a sufficiently accurate account of the death
of this lamented traveller.<a name="pagexix" id="pagexix"></a><span class="pageno">[xix]</span></p>

<p>From the statements which have from time
to time appeared in the press, the public are
already aware, that the presents and the treaty
intended for the Sheikh of Bornou were duly
presented and accepted, and that the boat which
caused Mr. Richardson so much anxiety on the
road was ultimately launched, as he desired, on
lake Tchad, and employed in the survey of that
celebrated piece of water. It is unnecessary
here to notice the results of this survey, or of
the explorations subsequently undertaken by
Messrs. Barth and Overweg. These gentlemen,
it is to be hoped, will be more fortunate than
their colleague, and return to give in person an
account of their exertions and discoveries.</p>

<p>I shall conclude by expressing my hope
that Mr. Richardson's reputation will not suffer
from the way in which I have superintended
the publication of his remains, and my regret
that I am not able to do justice to the great
services which he has rendered to philology by
his copious collections of vocabularies of the
languages, both of the Sahara and of the various
kingdoms of Central Africa.</p>

<p>P.S. It may be as well to mention that
the extensive collections of vocabularies made
by Mr. Richardson are now preserved at the
Foreign Office, together with specimens of translations
from the Scriptures. All these collections
are extremely valuable, but especially those
of the Bornou language, which were much
wanted.</p>

</div>

<p>Since my return from a first tour of exploration
in the Great Sahara I had carefully revolved in my
mind the possibility of a much greater undertaking,
namely, a political and commercial expedition to
some of the most important kingdoms of Central
Africa. The plan appeared to me feasible; and
when I laid it in all its details before her Majesty's
Government, they determined, after mature consideration,
to empower me to carry it out. Two
objects, one principal, necessarily kept somewhat<a name="page2" id="page2"></a><span class="pageno">[2]</span>
in the background&mdash;the abolition of the slave-trade;
one subsidiary, and yet important in itself&mdash;the promotion
of commerce by way of the Great Desert;
appeared to me, and to the distinguished persons
who promoted the undertaking, of sufficient magnitude
to justify considerable sacrifices. Much preliminary
discussion took place; but the impediments
and difficulties that naturally start up at the commencement
of any enterprise possessing the character
of novelty were gradually overcome, and in
the summer of 1849 it was generally known that
I was about to proceed, by way of Tripoli and the
Sahara, and the hitherto unexplored kingdom of
Aheer, to endeavour to open commercial relations
and conclude treaties with any native power so
disposed, but especially with the Sultan of Bornou.
It was not thought necessary, however, to surround
my Mission with any circumstances of diplomatic
splendour; and it was still in the character of
Yak&#333;b&mdash;a name already known throughout the
greater portion of the route intended to be traversed&mdash;that
I proposed to resume my intercourse with the
Moors, the Fezzanees, the Tibboos, the Tuaricks,
and other tribes and peoples of the desert and the
countries beyond.</p>

<p>The various preparations for the expedition
occupied a considerable time before I could leave
Europe; but I shall pass over all account of these,
and enter as soon as possible on the plain narrative
of my journey. We reached Tripoli on January<a name="page3" id="page3"></a><span class="pageno">[3]</span>
the 31st, 1850, having come circuitously by way of
Algeria and Tunis. Divers reasons, on which it is
unnecessary to enlarge, had prevented us from
adopting a more direct route. However, there had,
properly speaking, been no time lost, and we had still
to look forward to inevitable delays. An expedition
of the kind we were about to undertake cannot be
performed in a hurry, especially in Africa. In that
continent everything is carried on in a deliberate
manner. The climate is in itself suggestive of procrastination;
and no one who has there had to
do with officials, even of our own country, until he
has himself felt the enervating influence of the
atmosphere, can fail to have been held in ludicrous
suspense between indignation and surprise.</p>

<p>It must here be mentioned that, associated with
me in this expedition, were two Prussian gentlemen,
Drs. Barth and Overweg, who had volunteered to
accompany me in my expedition in the character of
scientific observers.</p>

<p>The political and commercial nature of my Mission
by no means excluded such auxiliaries. It was
desirable that every advantage should be taken of
this opportunity to explore Central Africa in every
point of view; and when the proposition came to
me under the sanction of Chevalier Bunsen, and
received the approval of her Majesty's Government,
I could not but be delighted. It was arranged that
these gentlemen should travel at the expense and<a name="page4" id="page4"></a><span class="pageno">[4]</span>
under the protection of Great Britain, and that their
reports should be duly forwarded to the Foreign
Office.</p>

<p>Drs. Barth and Overweg, with European impetuosity,
eager at once to grapple with adventure
and research, had pushed on whilst I waited for
final instructions from Lord Palmerston. They had
arrived at Tripoli about twelve days before me,
and, as I afterwards learned, had usefully and
pleasantly occupied their time in excursions to the
neighbouring mountains, which I had previously
visited and examined on my way to Ghadamez.</p>

<p>We learned on landing, that a good deal of the
anxiety I had felt on account of my slow progress
from England had been thrown away. Our arms,
instruments, and stores, had not yet arrived from
Malta. However, they were promised for an early
date, and the hospitable reception afforded us by
Mr. Consul-general Crowe, as well as the knowledge
that a vast number of small details of preparation
could be immediately commenced, contributed
to console us.</p>

<p>Among the things expected, and which arrived
in due time, was a boat built by order of the
Government in Malta dockyard. It was sent in
two sides, and I wished to carry it in that state.
But this proved impossible, and just before starting
we were compelled to saw each side into two pieces,
which were to be carried slung in nets upon a<a name="page5" id="page5"></a><span class="pageno">[5]</span>
couple of powerful camels. This boat was expressly
intended for the navigation of Lake Tchad.<a name="anchor1" id="anchor1"></a><a href="#footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It was universally admired at Tripoli; and, as it
will be useless to bring it back, will form a most
acceptable present for the Sultan of Bornou. I
cannot omit to notice, in passing, the courtesy and
attention of the authorities of Malta with whom I
have been in communication; they have all done
their best to forward the objects of the Mission.</p>

<p>A good deal of the delay that took place at
Tripoli arose from causes over which it was impossible
to exert any control, and principally from the
bad weather, which cut off all communication with
Malta. We used to go about relating the anecdote
of Charles V. illustrative of the inhospitable seasons
of this coast. "Which are the best ports of Barbary?"
inquired the Emperor of the famous Admiral
Dorea. "The months of June, July, and August,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>Whilst waiting for the winds to waft us so many
desirable things, we actively engaged in hiring
camels, procuring servants, and otherwise making
ready for a start. The details of all these preparations,
which cost me prodigious anxiety, as I was
obliged to study at the same time efficiency and
economy, are described in a voluminous mass of correspondence;
but I should not think of presenting<a name="page6" id="page6"></a><span class="pageno">[6]</span>
them to the general public, which will be satisfied
probably to know that at length everything was
found to be in due order, and our long-expected
departure was fixed for the 30th of March.</p>

<p>I had taken care, immediately on my arrival at
Tripoli, to write to Mr. Gagliuffi, the British Consul
at Mourzuk, announcing my approach and enclosing
a despatch from the Foreign Office. Moreover I had
requested this gentleman at once to send to Gh&acirc;t for
an escort of Tuaricks, so that we might not be unnecessarily
detained in Fezzan; and to suggest that
the Sheikhs should be assembled by the time we
arrived, that the treaty I had to propose to them
might be discussed. My former visit to this place
will in some respects pave the way. Throughout the
Turkish provinces of Tripoli and Fezzan a circular
letter given to us by Izhet Pasha, and the letters of
the Bey of Tunis in other quarters, will no doubt
prove of some assistance, although such documents
must lose much of their influence in the very secluded
districts through which we shall be compelled to
pass. After all, we must trust principally to our
own tact, to the good will of the natives, and to that
vague respect of English power which is beginning
to spread in the Sahara.</p>

<p>The composition of our caravan will of course
fluctuate throughout the whole line of route; but I
may as well mention the most important personages
who were to start with me from Tripoli. Setting
aside my colleagues, Barth and Overweg, there was,<a name="page7" id="page7"></a><span class="pageno">[7]</span>
in the first place, the interpreter, Yusuf Moknee, a
man really of some importance among his people,
but considering himself with far too extravagant a
degree of respect. He is the son of the famous
Moknee, who was Governor of the province of
Fezzan during the period of the Karamanly Bashaws.
He has squandered his father's estate in
intemperate drinking. Nevertheless I have been
recommended to take him as a dragoman, and give
him a fair trial, as his only vice really seems to be
attachment to the bottle. I suspect he will not find
many opportunities of indulging his propensity in
the Sahara; so that, as long as he is <i>en route</i>, he
may prove to be that phenomenon, a man without a
fault! At any rate I must be content with him,
especially as he is willing to sign a contract promising
to be a pattern of sobriety! There is no one
else in Tripoli so suitable for my purpose. He is a
handsome, dark-featured fellow, and when in his
bright-blue gown, white burnoose, and elegant fez,
makes a really respectable figure. I must dress
him up well for state occasions. Even in the
desert one is often judged by the livery of one's
servants.</p>

<p>The individuals next in importance to Moknee
are, perhaps, the Chaouches, as they are called here&mdash;Arab
cavaliers, who are to act as janissaries. There
is one big fellow for me, and one little fellow for the
Germans. How they will behave remains to be seen;
but I suspect they will give us some trouble. Then<a name="page8" id="page8"></a><span class="pageno">[8]</span>
there are a number of free blacks from Tunis, some
married, others not, who are to return to their homes
in Soudan, Bornou, and Mandara, under our protection.
Some of these have agreed to travel partly
on their own account, or nearly so, whilst others will
be paid and act as servants. One of them, named
Ali, is a fine, dashing young fellow. They are very
unimportant people here, but as we advance on our
route will no doubt prove of some service, especially
when we fairly enter upon the Black Countries. A
marabout of Fezzan also accompanies us, and our
camel-drivers are from the same country. They
arrived with a caravan from Mourzuk, and we were
some time detained by the necessity of allowing them
and their beasts to rest before recommencing their
march over the very arduous country that lies between
this and the confines of Fezzan.</p>

<p>Our progress will necessarily be slow, as all travelling
is in the desert. Camels can rarely exceed
three miles an hour, and often make but two. We
may calculate their average progress at two miles
and a half, so that the reader will be pleased to
bear in mind, that when I speak of a laborious day
of twelve hours, he must not imagine us to have
advanced more than thirty miles.</p>

<p>Before commencing the narrative of my journey,
it may be as well to introduce a few observations on
the commerce at present carried on with the interior
by way of Tripoli. In addition to the mere acquisition
of geographical, statistical, and other information,<a name="page9" id="page9"></a><span class="pageno">[9]</span>
I look upon the great object of our mission
to be the promotion, by all prudent means, of legitimate
trade. This will be the most effectual way of
putting a stop to that frightful system by which all
the Central Provinces of Africa are depopulated,
and all the littoral regions demoralized. When the
negro races begin to make great profits by exporting
the natural products of their country, they will then,
and perhaps then only, cease to export their brethren
as slaves. On this account, therefore, I take
great interest in whatever has reference to caravan
trade.</p>

<p>There are now four general routes followed by
the trading caravans from the Barbary coast, leading
to four different points of that great belt of
populous country that stretches across Central
Africa,&mdash;viz. to Wada&iuml;, Bornou, Soudan, and Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>Wada&iuml; sends to the coast at Bengazi a biennial
caravan, accompanied by a large number of slaves.
The chief articles of legitimate traffic are elephants'
teeth and ostrich feathers. This route is a modern
ramification of interior trade, and was opened only
during the last century. It is calculated that the
exports of Bengazi form one-third of the whole of
those of Tripoli.</p>

<p>Bornou sends to the coast by way of Fezzan, I
am sorry to say, chiefly slaves; but a quantity of
ivory is now likewise forwarded by this route.</p>

<p>Soudan exports slaves, senna, ivory, wax, indigo,<a name="page10" id="page10"></a><span class="pageno">[10]</span>
skins, &amp;c. &amp;c. Nearly half of the commerce with
this important country consists of legitimate articles
of trade and barter. This is very encouraging, and
the brief history of some of these objects of legal
commerce is exceedingly interesting. Wax, for
example, began to be sent seventeen years ago;
elephants' teeth, fifteen; and indigo, only four years
ago.</p>

<p>Timbuctoo now scarcely forwards anything but
gold to the coast of Tripoli, together with wax and
ivory, but no slaves. The gold is brought by the
merchants in diminutive roughly-made rings, which
they often carry in dirty little bags, concealed in the
breasts of their gowns.</p>

<p>I am exceedingly glad to learn that the Ghadamsee
merchants, who formerly embarked two-thirds
of their capital in the slave-trade, have now
only one-fourth engaged in that manner. This is
progress. It has been partly brought about by the
closing of the Tunisian slave-mart, partly by the
increase of objects of legitimate commerce in the
markets of Soudan. The merchants of Fezzan have
still to learn that money may be invested to more
advantage in things than in persons; but their education
has been undertaken, and however slow the
light may be in forcing its way to their eyes, it will
reach them at last, there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>The trade in senna is always considerable. Last
year a thousand cantars were brought, from the
country of the Tibboos and from Aheer. The latter<a name="page11" id="page11"></a><span class="pageno">[11]</span>
place supplies the best. New objects of exportation
may no doubt be discovered. Already gum-dragon
and cassia have been added to the list of articles
brought from Soudan; and when once treaties of
commerce have been entered into, and merchants
begin to find security in the desert and protection
from the native princes, there is no doubt that a very
large intercourse may be established with the interior
countries of Africa&mdash;an intercourse that will
at once prove of immense benefit to us as a manufacturing
nation, and advance materially that great
object of all honest men, the abolition of the accursed
traffic in human beings. It is the latter object that
chiefly occupies my mind, but I shall not attempt
to bring it before the native princes in too abrupt a
manner. In some cases, indeed, to allude to it at
all would be disastrous. The promotion of legitimate
traffic must, after all, be our great lever.</p>

<p>I do not profess in this place to do more than
give a few hints on the present state of trade in
Tripoli, and the vast tract of half-desert country on
which it leans. What I have said is perhaps sufficient
to impart some idea of the nature of the
relations between the Barbary coast and the interior,
and to suggest the importance of the enterprise
on which I am engaged. Briefly, the exportation
of slaves to Tripoli and beyond, in spite of
certain changes of route, is as rife as ever, and in
this respect everything remains to be done. But, on
the other hand, the trade which, I trust, is providentially<a name="page12" id="page12"></a><span class="pageno">[12]</span>
intended to supersede this inhuman traffic,
is on the increase, though slightly. If we can pave
the way for the civilising steps of European commerce,
either by treaties or by personal influence,
we shall have accomplished a great work. Let us
hope and pray that the necessary health, strength,
and power of persuasion be granted to us!</p>

</div>

<p>The preliminary miseries of a great journey being
at length over, I rose early on the morning of the
30th of March and started from the Masheeah,
a kind of suburb of Tripoli, distant in the country,
at six. Hope and the spirit of adventure sustained
my courage; but it is always sad to part with those
we love, even at the call of duty. However, I at
length mustered strength to bid adieu to my wife&mdash;the
almost silent adieu of affection. How many
things that were thought were left unsaid on either
side! It will be pleasant to fill up all blanks when
we talk of these days after a safe return from this
arduous undertaking.</p>

<p>It was a fresh, cheerful morning, succeeding
several days of sultry weather&mdash;an auspicious commencement<a name="page14" id="page14"></a><span class="pageno">[14]</span>
of the journey. My chaouch, Mohammed
Souweea, preceded me on his great horse, murmuring
some Arab ditty, and I followed hard on my
little donkey. The desert assails the walls of Tripoli,
and in half an hour we were in the Sahara
sands, which here and there rise in great mounds.
I should have liked to have pushed on to some considerable
distance at once; but the habits of the
country are dilatory, and one must conform to them.
In a couple of hours we came to the chaouch's tent,
where he had a wife, five children, and seven brothers,
one of whom was blind. He, too, was to go
through the sad ceremony of parting with his
family; and he burst into tears when they surrounded
and embraced him. I am sorry to say, however,
that before this affecting scene was concluded,
a quarrel had began between the blind man and the
chaouch's wife, about two Tunisian piastres which
were missing, she accusing him of theft and he
indignantly repelling the charge. These Easterns
seem to have minds constructed on different patterns
from ours, and are apt to introduce such petty
discussions at the most solemn moments; but we
must not, therefore, be hasty in concluding that there
is any sham in their sorrow, or affectation in their
pathetic bewailings.</p>

<p>They brought in a bowl of milk, and as the
chaouch still continued to caress his children, I left
him to pass the night in his tent, and pushed on to
Wady Majeeneen, where my portion of the caravan<a name="page15" id="page15"></a><span class="pageno">[15]</span>
had already encamped. Mr. F. Warrington, with
my German colleagues, were a little in advance.
The horses of the Pasha's cavalry were feeding
around; for when the first belt of sand is past, the
country becomes an undulating plain&mdash;a prairie,
as they would call it in America&mdash;covered with
patches of corn herbage. Here and there are fields of
barley; and a few Arab tents, with flocks and herds
near at hand, give a kind of animation to the scene.</p>

<p>Next day (21st) it rained hard; but we went on
a little to overtake Drs. Barth and Overweg, whom
we found in company with Mr. F. Warrington, Mr.
Vice-consul Reade, and Mr. Gaines the American
consul. One of Mr. Interpreter Moknee's wives
had also come out here, to have some settlement
with her husband about support before she let him
go. The gentleman has two wives, both negresses;
and had already made an arrangement for the other,
who has several children, of six mahboubs per
month. First come, first served. The second wife,
who has two children, only got three mahboubs a
month. However, when matters were arranged,
the pair became rather more loving. These settlements
are always hard matters to manage, all the
world over, and it is pleasant to get rid of them.
By the way, a son of the worthy Moknee, by a
white woman now dead&mdash;a lad of about twelve years
of age&mdash;accompanies us, at least as far as Mourzuk.</p>

<p>The most remarkable persons, however, whom
I found at the encampment were a couple of insane<a name="page16" id="page16"></a><span class="pageno">[16]</span>
fellows, determined to follow us&mdash;perhaps to show
"by one satiric touch" what kind of madcap enterprise
was ours. The first was a Neapolitan, who
had dogged me all the while I was at Tripoli, pestering
me to make a contract with him as servant.
To humour his madness, I never said I would not;
and the poor fellow, taking my silence for consent,
had come out asking for his master. They tried to
send him away, but he would take orders from
none but me. I gave him two loaves of bread and
a Tunisian piastre, and also made him a profound
bow, politely requesting him to go about his business.
He did so in a very dejected manner. During
the time he was with the caravan he worked as hard
as any one else in his tattered clothes, and, perhaps,
he would have been of more use than many a
sane person.</p>

<p>The other was a madman indeed, a Muslim,
with an unpleasant habit of threatening to cut everybody's
throat. Hearing that we were going to Soudan,
he followed us, bringing with him a quantity
of old metal, principally copper, with which he proposed
to trade. He gave himself out as a shereef,
or descendant of the Prophet. No sooner had he
arrived than he begun to quarrel on all sides, and,
of course, talked very freely of cutting throats, stabbing,
shooting, and other humorous things. Every
one was afraid of him. He fawned, however, on us
Europeans, whilst he had a large knife concealed
under his clothes ready to strike. They were obliged<a name="page17" id="page17"></a><span class="pageno">[17]</span>
at length to disarm him, and send him back under
a guard to Tripoli. We here took leave of Mr.
Reade, who gave me some last explanations about
letters to the interior. It rained furiously in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>We were kept idle a whole day by the rain;
but starting on the second, turned off sharp in the
afternoon towards the mountains, and encamped at
length in a pretty place fronting the great ascent
of Gharian. The appearance of the chain here differs
in no important particular from that of any
other part of the Tripoline Atlas. The formation is
calcareous, but the colours vary to the eye by the
admixture of minerals. Groups of sandstone are
not uncommon. Rounded, rugged heads, vary the
outline of the plateau; and here and there are deep,
abrupt valleys, cut down through the range, with
groves of fig-trees, almonds, aloes, pomegranates,
and even grapes, nestling in their laps. Bright
water-courses, springing up in the depths of these
ravines, sustain the streaks of half-buried verdure.</p>

<p>We rose early to commence the ascent. It is
not difficult unless the camels are very heavily
laden; but we did not reach the Castle of Gharian
until three in the afternoon. Our caravan dotted
with groups of various outline and colour the slopes
of the spur, up the side of which the track wound,
in a very picturesque manner. Sometimes the foremost
camels stood still and complained; and then
there was a half-halt throughout the whole long<a name="page18" id="page18"></a><span class="pageno">[18]</span>
line. The drivers plied the stick pretty freely on
the gaunt flanks of their beasts; the cry of "<i>Isa!
Isa!</i>" resounded in irregular chorus; pebbles and
stones came leaping down at the steep parts. As
we rose over the brown slopes, the thin forests of
olive-trees partly covering the undulating plateau
beyond, with fields of barley and wheat here and
there, gladdened our eyes, and contrasted well with
the hungry country we had left in the rear.</p>

<p>The castle, sufficiently picturesque in structure,
is placed over a deep ravine, but is commanded by
the mountain behind. We turned back on nearing
it, and beheld the plain we had traversed appearing
like the sea enveloped in mist and cloud. In
fine weather the minarets of Tripoli can be seen,
but now the northern horizon faded off in haze.
On either hand the steep declivities of the hills presented
a wall-like surface, here and there battered
into breaches, from out of which burst little tufts of
green, revealing the presence of springs.</p>

<p>There are 200 troops stationed at the castle
under Colonel Saleh, to whom we paid an official
visit; as also to the Ka&iuml;d of Gharian. In both cases
we were hospitably treated to pipes, coffee, and
lemonade. In this canton are said to be the fanciful
number of "one hundred and one" Arab districts,
inhabited by the Troglodytes. All the villages, indeed,
hereabouts, are underground: not a building
is to be seen above, except at wide intervals an old
miserable, crumbling, Arab fort. The people are<a name="page19" id="page19"></a><span class="pageno">[19]</span>
easily kept in order by the summary Turkish
method of proceeding; for they are entirely disarmed,
and matchlocks, powder and ball, are contraband
articles. The first word of an Oriental
tax-gatherer is "Pay!" and the second is "Kill!"</p>

<p>The outset of a journey in the East is usually
employed in finding out the vices of one's servants.
Their virtues, I suppose, become manifest afterwards.
We were on the point of sending our
chaouch back from Gharian for dishonesty; but as
we reflected that any substitute might be still worse,
we passed over the robbery of our barley, and
merely determined to keep a good look-out. This
worthy, though useful in his sphere, often, as I had
anticipated, proved a sad annoyance to us. When
he seemed to refrain from cheating and stealing, he
rendered our lives troublesome by constant quarrellings
and rows&mdash;he and his fellow attached to my
German companions&mdash;<i>Arcades ambo!</i></p>

<p>Mr. Frederick Warrington and the American
Consul took leave of us on the morning of the 5th.
Starting afterwards about nine, we soon left the
Castle of Gharian behind, and continued our course
in a direction about south-west, amongst olive-woods
and groves of fig-trees. The country was varied
enough in appearance as we proceeded. Great
masses of rock and cultivated slopes alternated.
The vegetation seemed all fresh, and sometimes
vigorous. Few birds, except wild pigeons, appeared.
Many of the heights which we passed were crowned<a name="page20" id="page20"></a><span class="pageno">[20]</span>
with ruined castles, mementoes of the past dominion
of the Arabs. We saw some of the Troglodytes
coming from underground now and then, and
pausing to look at us. Their dress is a simple
barracan, or blanket-mantle, thrown around them;
few indulge in the luxury of a shirt; and they go
armed with a great thick stick terminating in a
hook. They look cleanly and healthy in spite of
their burrowing life, but are fox-like in character
as in manners, and bear a reputation for dishonesty.</p>

<p>A little after mid-day we descried afar off the
village of Kaleebah, which is built above-ground,
and occupies a most commanding position on a
bold mountain-top. It remained in sight ahead a
long time, cheating us with an appearance of nearness.
The inhabitants resemble, in all respects, their
mole-brethren, and occupy themselves chiefly in cultivating
olives and barley. Government exacts
from them two imposts&mdash;one special, of a hundred
and fifty mahboubs on the olive-crops; and one
general, of five hundred mahboubs. We passed the
village at length, and encamped an hour beyond.
Here were the last olive-groves which were to cheer
our eyes for many a long month&mdash;many a long
year, maybe. Their dark masses covered the swells
right and left, and near at hand isolated trees formed
pleasant patches of shadow.</p>

<p>We left our camping-ground at length next
day, having overcome the obstinate sluggishness of
the blacks, and marched nearly nine hours. The<a name="page21" id="page21"></a><span class="pageno">[21]</span>
barren forms of the desert begin now to appear,
the ground being broken up into huge hills that
run mostly in circles, and groups, and broad stony
valleys. The formation is limestone, often containing
flints, with a little sandstone. Patches of barley
here and there splashed this arid surface with green.
At a great distance we saw two or three Arab tents,
and one flock of sheep. Towards evening began to
appear a number of beautiful bushy trees, somewhat
resembling our oak in size and appearance.
The Arabs call them "Batoum." They do not seem
to have yet received their proper botanical classification.
Desfontaines describes the tree as the <i>Pistacia
Atlanticis</i>. It greatly resembles the <i>Pistacia
lentiscus</i> of Linn&aelig;us. A few solitary birds, a flight
of crows, lizards and beetles on the ground; no
other signs of life.</p>

<p>The next day the country became more barren
still, and the batoum disappeared. The patches
of barley likewise ceased to cheer the eye; and
little pools of water no longer sparkled in the rocky
bottoms, as near Kaleebah. The geological formation
was nearly the same as yesterday; but pieces
of crystalline gypsum covered the ground, and the
limestone here and there took the form of alabaster.
Some of the hills that close in the huge basin-like
valleys are of considerable elevation, and have conic
volcanic forms. All was dreary, and desolate, and
sad, except that some ground-larks whirled about;
lizards and beetles still kept crossing our path;<a name="page22" id="page22"></a><span class="pageno">[22]</span>
and a single chameleon did not fade into sand-colour
in time to escape notice. No animals of the
chase were seen; but our blacks picked up the
dung of the ostrich, and a horn of the aoudad. Here
and there we observed the broken columns of Roman
milestones, some of them covered with illegible
inscriptions. The sockets generally remain
perfect. We saluted the memory of the sublime
road-makers.</p>

<p>About noon, as we were traversing these solitudes
in our usual irregular order of march, a
crowd of moving things came in sight. It proved
to be a slave-caravan, entirely composed of young
girls. The Gadamsee merchants who owned them
recognised me, and shook me by the hand. Our
old black woman was soon surrounded by a troop
of the poor slave-girls; and when she related to
them how she was returning free to her country
under the protection of the English, and wished
them all the same happiness, they fell round her
weeping and kissing her feet. One poor naked
girl had slung at her back a child, with a strange
look of intelligence. I was about to give her a
piece of money, but could not; for, the tears bursting
to my eyes, I was obliged to turn away. The
sight of these fragments of families stolen away to
become drudges or victims of brutal passion in a
foreign land, invariably produced this effect upon
me. This caravan consisted of some thirty girls
and twenty camel-loads of elephants' teeth. They<a name="page23" id="page23"></a><span class="pageno">[23]</span>
had been seventy days on their way from Gh&acirc;t, including,
however, thirty-four days of rest. Most
of these poor wretches had performed journeys on
their way to bondage which would invest me with
imperishable renown as a traveller could I accomplish
them.</p>

<p>The caravan was soon lost to view as it wound
along the track by which we had come. This day
was exceedingly hot, whereas the previous days had
reminded us of a cool summer in England. The
nights have hitherto been clear, and the zodiacal
light is always brilliant. Our blacks keep up pretty
well. There are now nine of them; five men, three
women, and a boy. They eat barley-meal and oil,
and now and then get a cup of coffee. I also feed
the Fezzanee marabout, besides those specially attached
to the expedition. As to the camel-drivers,
they are an ill-bred, disobliging set, and I give
them nothing extra. How different are our negroes!
They are most cheerful. As we proceed, they
run hither and thither collecting edible herbs; and,
like children, making the way more long in their
sport. Sometimes their amusements are less pleasant,
and they seem systematically to take refuge
from <i>ennui</i>, in a quarrel. Two of them began to pelt
each other with stones to-day; allies dropped in on
either side; laughter was succeeded by execrations;
and the whole caravan at length came to loggerheads.</p>

<p>The sidr, or lote-tree, is abundant in these
parts, and it is curious to notice how in the spring<a name="page24" id="page24"></a><span class="pageno">[24]</span>
season the green leaves sprout out all over the
white burnt-up shrub. All vegetation in the desert
that is not perfectly new seems utterly withered by
time. There is scarcely any medium between the
bud and the dead leaf. Infancy is scorched at once
into old age.</p>

<p>As we advanced, the country appeared to put on
sterner forms, until suddenly, in the afternoon, the
rocks opened to disclose the Wady Esh-Shr&acirc;b
nestling amidst limestone hills, and containing the
pleasant oasis of Mizdah. Its beauties consist, in
reality, but of a few patches of green barley and
scanty palm-groves; but, in contrast to the sultry
desert, the scene appeared really enchanting.</p>

<p>We have now left the Troglodytes behind us.
Mizdah (eight summer and ten winter days from
Ghadamez, three short days from Gharian, and the
same from Benioleed) is built above-ground, and
consists of a double village, or rather two contiguous
villages, inhabited by people of the Arab race.
Each division is fortified after a fashion, with walls
now crumbling, and with round crenulated towers.
One large tower, some fifty feet high, has stood, they
say, four hundred years. I asked, What was the
use of these fortifications? and was na&iuml;vely told
they were for the purposes of <i>shamatah</i>, "war," or
rather "rows." And true enough, before the Turks
extended their power so far, these two beggarly
villages, fifty miles from any neighbours, were in
constant hostility one with the other. Each had its<a name="page25" id="page25"></a><span class="pageno">[25]</span>
great tower, a giant among all the little towers&mdash;a
kind of keep, to which the defeated party retired to
recruit its strength or escape utter destruction.
This is likewise the case with many other double
towns of the Sahara, and seems to prove that war is
the native passion and trade of man. At any rate,
punishment for such turbulence has not been wanting;
for in this, as in so many other cases, whilst these
poor wretches were engaged in cutting one another's
throats, the conqueror has come and established his
tyranny. They are now paying the penalty of their
love of shamatah in the shape of an impost of four
hundred mahboubs per annum, and in numbers are
reduced to about a hundred and thirty heads of
families.</p>

<p>We had some additional camel-drivers from
Kaleebah, who, of course, endeavoured to extort
more than they had agreed for. When we had
squabbled with them a little, we had the honour of
receiving Sheikh Omer, of Mizdah, in the tent. He
came with about thirty notables of the place, the
greater part of whom sat outside the doorway, whilst
he stroked his beard within, indulging in a touch of
eau de Cologne and a cup of coffee. We read him
the circular-letter of Izhet Pasha, and received all
manner of civilities. The next day, indeed, he came
to us to serve as guide through the country over
which he wields delegated dominion. He had not
far to go. His empire is a mere pocket one. The
palm-trees are about three hundred in number, and<a name="page26" id="page26"></a><span class="pageno">[26]</span>
there are but half-a-dozen diminutive fields of barley
ripening in the ear, fed by irrigation from several
wells which supply tolerably sweet water. A few
onion-beds occur in the little gardens, which are
partially shaded by some small trees.</p>

<p>Sheikh Omer supplied us with copious bowls of
milk; the most refreshing thing, after all, that can
be drank in the heat of the day. We were, however,
impatient to get off, but had to wait for a blacksmith
to shoe the horses of our chaouch. The only knowing
man in this department was away at some neighbouring
village, and it was necessary to send messengers
to find him. There being nothing better to
do, the day, accordingly, was spent in quarrelling.
We had at least a hundred tongue-skirmishes between
our people and the people of Mizdah&mdash;between our
chaouch and the other chaouch&mdash;between our chaouch
and the sheikh of the country&mdash;between Yusuf and
the Fezzanee&mdash;between every individual black and
every other individual black&mdash;Between our chaouch
particularly and all the people of Mizdah:&mdash;in short,
there were as many rows as it were possible for a
logician to find relations betwixt man and man.</p>

<p>I must not forget that our chaouch, in spite of all
this effervescence, had got up this morning in a
very pious state of mind. He told us that a marabout
had appeared to him in a dream, and had said,
"O man! go to Soudan with the Christians, and
thou shalt return with the blessing of God upon
thee!" This vision seemed to have made a deep<a name="page27" id="page27"></a><span class="pageno">[27]</span>
impression upon him at the time, but he had forgotten
it long before it had ceased to be the subject
of my anxious thoughts&mdash;"O God, I beseech thee,
indeed, to give us a prosperous journey! But thy
will be done. We are entirely in thy hands!"</p>

<p><i>April 10th.</i>&mdash;We had another glorious row this
morning before starting. A man who had gone to
fetch the blacksmith, and found him not, demanded
payment of two Tunisian piastres. The chaouch,
suspecting that he never went at all, but concealed
himself in the village, would not pay him. This
brought on a collision. Sheikh Omer supported
us; and so all the people of the other village took
part against us. Two of them were armed, and
some of us thought it advisable to load our pistols.
At last, however, we pushed them away from the
tent by force; and, in the first moment of indignation,
wrote a letter to the Pasha about them.
Hearing of this, they came to beg us not to send
the letter, which was accordingly torn up by the
Sheikh. My chaouch was the great actor in all
this affair; and it was necessary that I should support
him, even if he were a little wrong, otherwise
he would have had no confidence in himself or us
in cases of difficulty.</p>

<p>The Sheikh, who, as well as ourselves, has lost
some little things during these days, gives the people
of Mizdah a very bad character. In the scuffle, I
noticed that they called him <i>Fezzanee</i>, which is used
as a term of insult in these parts. "All the Fezzanees<a name="page28" id="page28"></a><span class="pageno">[28]</span>
are bad people, and all their women courtezans,"
says my chaouch.</p>

<p>There is a large leopard reported to be abroad
near the oasis of Mizdah. He escaped from Abdel-Galeel,
who brought him from Soudan, and creates
great terror among the camel-drivers. They say,
with unspeakable horror, "The nimr eats all the
weak camels!" He has already devoured two. He
drinks in the neighbouring wady, where there is
water six months of the year. During the remainder
he is capable, they say, of doing without
drinking.</p>

</div>

<p>We started for Mizdah, at length, towards noon,
Sheikh Omer bringing us a little on our way, and,
begging to be well spoken of in high quarters; and
after passing the ruins of two Arab castles that
frown over the southern side of Wady Esh-Shr&acirc;b,
got into a gloomy country, exactly resembling that
on the other side of the oasis, except that the strata
of the limestone rocks, instead of being horizontal
are inclined. The whole desert, however, wears
a more arid appearance. Yet there were some
lote-trees here and there, and a few tholukhs. The,
traces of the aoudad were noticed; and the blacks,<a name="page30" id="page30"></a><span class="pageno">[30]</span>
picking up its dung, smelt it as musk, saying, "It
is very good." As I jogged on upon my camel, the
oppressive heat caused me to sleep and dream in
the saddle of things that had now become the province
of memory.</p>

<p>More quarrels! The chaouches are boiling over
again; they must fight it out between them. No
doubt they are both correct in exchanging the
epithet of "thief." Scarcely has the grumbling of
these two terrible fellows died away, when the
blacks are at it amongst themselves. He who has
two wives gets hold of his blunderbuss, and threatens
to blow himself to pieces. Nobody interferes;
there is little public spirit in a caravan: so he consents
to an explanation, saying sententiously, "My
little wife is mad." The fact is, his two helpmates,
one young and one old, are vastly too much for him,
as they would be for most men. He moves along
in a perpetual family tornado. The mother of the
young one, a sort of derwish negress, is a tremendous
old intriguer, and stirs up at least one feud a day.
Quarrelling is meat and drink to her.</p>

<p>It would have been out of character had not Ali
got up a little convulsion on his own account. One
day, in the Targhee's absence, he took his gun to
"play at powder," and using English material, succeeded
in splitting the machine near the lock.
When the Targhee returned, and found what
damage had been done, he began first to whimper,
and then working himself up into a towering passion,<a name="page31" id="page31"></a><span class="pageno">[31]</span>
swore he would shoot the culprit. Scarcely
with that weapon, O Targhee! When his excitement
was over, I offered to make a collection among
the people to indemnify him; but he shook his
head, laughed, and refused. The gun was nearly
all his property, and he had just bought it new at
Tripoli.<a name="anchor2" id="anchor2"></a><a href="#footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>All this part of Northern Africa may be compared
to an archipelago, with seas of various
breadths dividing the islands. Three days took us
from Tripoli to Gharian, and three more to Mizdah.
We were now advancing across the preliminary
desert stretching in front of the great plateau of the
Hamadah, which defends, like a wall of desolation,
the approaches of Fezzan from the north. At first
occur broken limestone hills, as previous to Mizdah;
but when we approach the plateau the aspect of the
hills changes, and they are composed chiefly of
variegated marl mixed with gypsum, and with a
covering of limestone. Fossil shells were picked up
at intervals. Some huge, irregular masses, that
appeared ahead during the first day, were mistaken
by us for the edge of the plateau; but we broke
through, and left them right and left as we proceeded.
They are great masses of limestone and red
clay, in which are scooped deep valleys, many of
them supplied with abundant herbage. As yet we<a name="page32" id="page32"></a><span class="pageno">[32]</span>
have never attained a level of more than 2500 feet
above the level of the sea. Water must exist
underground, if we may argue from the presence of
the aoudad and the gazelle. Indeed, out of the
line of route, amongst the hills, there are wells and
Arab tents. The presence of Roman remains reminds
us that the country has seen more prosperous
times. We encamped on the 11th in a wady, overlooked
by the ruins of a mausoleum, which had
assumed colossal proportions in the distance. Some
Berber letters were carved upon its walls; probably
by Tuaricks, who had formerly inhabited the
district.</p>

<p>One of our blacks this day killed a l&ecirc;fa, the
most dangerous species of snake; and several thobs
or lizards were caught. The greyhound of the
Fezzanee also ran down a hare. Next day it
procured us a gazelle; but with these exceptions
were seen only ground-larks, and what we call in
Lincolnshire water-wagtails.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that at this place our
chaouch sprained his ankle, and Dr. Overweg applied
spirits of camphor as lotion. This terrible fellow,
this huge swaggerer, this eater-up of ordinary timid
mortals, was reduced to the meekness of a lamb by
his slight accident; and for the first time since the
caravan was blessed with his presence did he remain
tranquil, breathing out from time to time a
soft complaint. In the course of the day he had
contrived to make himself particularly disagreeable.<a name="page33" id="page33"></a><span class="pageno">[33]</span>
First he fell out with the servant of the Germans,
Mahommed of Tunis. Then he quarrelled with us
all, because he picked up a blanket for somebody
and was refused his modest demand of three piastres
as a reward. We are heartily glad that he is tamed
for awhile.</p>

<p>On the 12th, shortly after we started, I happened
to look behind and saw, coming from the
west, some clouds that seemed to give promise of
rain. Already I felt the air cooled by anticipation,
but was soon undeceived. In the course of an hour
a gheblee began to blow, and continued to increase
in violence until it enervated the whole caravan.
Our poor black women began to drop with fatigue,
and we were compelled to place them on the camels.
Here was a foretaste of the desert, its hardships
and its terrors! The air was full of haze, through
which we could scarcely see the flagging camels,
with their huge burdens; and the men, as they
crawled along, were apparently ready to sink on the
ground in despair. We breathed the hot atmosphere
with difficulty and displeasure.</p>

<p>Right glad were we then, at length, to reach the
Wady Taghijah, where I at once recognised my old
desert friend, under whose spreading and heavy
boughs I once had passed a night alone in the
Sahara,&mdash;the ethel-tree! It is a species of <i>Pinus</i>,
growing chiefly in valleys of red clay on the top
of mounds, which are sometimes overshadowed by
a gigantic tree, with arms measuring four feet in<a name="page34" id="page34"></a><span class="pageno">[34]</span>
circumference. Of its wood are made the roofs of
houses, the frames of camel-saddles, and bowls for
holding milk and other food. With the berries and
a mixture of oil the people prepare their water-skins,
as well as tan leather. The valley is strewed
with huge branches, cut down for the purpose of
extracting resin. The ethel and the batoum are
the most interesting of desert-trees, and I shall
regret to exchange them for the tholukh. I wrote
down the names of fourteen shrubs found in the
valley of Taghijah: two of them, the sidr and the
katuf, are edible by man; the rest, with the exception
of the <i>hijatajel</i>, afford food for the camels.</p>

<p>In this valley, amongst the trees, we found the
flocks and horses of the Waled Bou Seif feeding.
This tribe&mdash;the children of the Father of the Sword&mdash;are
wandering Arabs, who have never acknowledged
the authority of the Tripoli Government.
They possess flocks, camels, and horses,&mdash;every element,
in fact, of desert wealth. All the mountains
near and round about Mizdah are claimed by them
as their country, which has never, perhaps, been reduced
by any power but the Roman. A young
man of the tribe, who was tending some sheep in
the valley, came to visit us. He was a fine, cheerful
fellow, with an open countenance, well dressed,
having, besides his barracan, red leather boots, trousers,
and a shirt. All his tribe, according to his
account, are so dressed. He boasted of the independence
of his people, who number three thousand<a name="page35" id="page35"></a><span class="pageno">[35]</span>
strong, and extend their influence as far south
as Ghareeah. The name of the tribe is derived, he
tells us, from a great warrior who once lived, and
was named by the people Bou Seif, because he
always carried a sword.</p>

<p>Our chaouch gave us an account of this young
man in the following strain:&mdash;"He is in very deed
a marabout! His wife never unveiled her face to
any man; and his own mother kisses his hand. He
is master of wealth, and never leaves this valley.
He has a house and flocks of sheep, and a hundred
camels, which always rest in the valley, bringing
forth young, and are never allowed to go into the
caravans," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>We were detained during the whole of the 13th,
because the water was at a distance and our people
had to fetch it. There were marks of recent rain in
the valley, but there is no well; only a few muddy
puddles. Dr. Barth, in wandering about, discovered
here a splendid mausoleum, of which he brought
back a sketch. It was fifty feet high, of Roman-Christian
architecture,&mdash;say of the fourth or fifth
century. No doubt, remains of cities and forts will
be discovered in these districts. Such tombs as
these indicate the presence in old time of a large
and opulent population.</p>

<p>One of the nagahs foaled this day, which partly
accounts for our detention. For some time afterwards
the cries of the little camel for its mother,
gone to feed, distressed us, and called to our mind<a name="page36" id="page36"></a><span class="pageno">[36]</span>
the life of toil and pain that was before the little
delicate, ungainly thing. It is worth noticing, that
the foal of the camel is frolicsome only for a few
days after its birth&mdash;soon becoming sombre in aspect
and solemn in gait. As if to prepare it betimes for
the rough buffeting of the world, the nagah never
licks or caresses its young, but spreads its legs to
lower the teat to the eager lips, and stares at the
horizon, or continues to browse.</p>

<p>Our people clubbed together and bought a goat
for a mahboub. They then divided it into five lots,
and an equal number of thongs was selected by the
five part-owners of the meat; these were given to a
stranger not concerned in the division, and he arbitrarily
placed one upon each piece, from which
decision there was no appeal.</p>

<p>On the 14th we rose before daybreak, and were
soon in motion. No change was noticed in the country,
limestone rocks and broad valleys running in all
directions. The ground is sometimes scattered with
fossil shells, some of the <i>exogyra</i>, others of the oyster
species; all flints. There were apparent traces of
the hy&aelig;na, but of no other wild animals. Some
sheep were at graze; and the long stubble of last
year's crop of barley, in irregular patches, told us
that when there is copious rain the Arabs come to
these parts for agricultural purposes. We noticed
the English hedge-thorn here and there, and thought
of the green lanes of our native land.</p>

<p>Nine hours' journey brought us to the valley of<a name="page37" id="page37"></a><span class="pageno">[37]</span>
Amjam, where there was a khafilah of senna encamped
among the trees. Water&mdash;rather bitter,
however&mdash;may be found here in shallow excavations;
and the whole place, with its patches of herbage, is
highly refreshing to the eye.</p>

<p>There are two new trees in this wady, both
interesting; the <i>Ghurdok</i> and the <i>Ajdaree</i>. The
<i>ghurdok</i>, on which the camels browse, is a large
bush with great thorns, and bears a red berry
about the size of our hip, or, as the marabout says,
of sheep's dung. People eat these berries and find
them good, with a saltish, bitter taste, and yet a
dash of sweetness. The <i>ajdaree</i> is also a thorny
bush, and at a distance something reminds one of
the English hedge-thorn. On a nearer approach
the leaves are found to be oval and filbert-shaped.
The berry, called <i>thomakh</i>, is nearly as large as
haws, but flatted at the sides: it is used medicinally,
being a powerful astringent in diarrhoea.</p>

<p>When the moon was two days old our people
practised a little of the ancient Sab&aelig;anism of the
Arabs&mdash;saluting it by kissing their hands, and offering
a short prayer.</p>

<p>On the 15th we at length sighted the edge of
the plateau of the Hamadah; and pushing on still
through desert hills and valleys, arrived at Wady
Tabooneeah, having been <i>en route</i> four days from
Mizdah. This valley is not so fertile as Amjam;
and the water is more bitter. Common salt, the
companion of gypsum, was observed to-day; and<a name="page38" id="page38"></a><span class="pageno">[38]</span>
wherever this is found there are bitter salts. Swallows
were skimming over the shrubs, and birds of
prey hovered about, now lying-to, as it were, overhead,
with beak and talons visible, now circling
upwards until they became mere specks. Lizards
and beetles abounded as usual; but the only plagues
of the place were the flies, which had followed the
camels from Gharian, and even from Tripoli. Men
usually carry their "black cares" along with them
in this way.</p>

<p>As we could not expect to commence the traject
of the dreaded plateau immediately, I resolved to
go upon a visit to the village of Western Ghareeah.
The camel-drivers of the caravan, of course, told
us that it was at the distance of one hour&mdash;<i>Saha
bas!</i> but we found it to be three hours in a north-east
direction. Time is of little consequence in the
desert, and no means are possessed or desired of
measuring it with exactitude. It has already been
observed by a traveller, that the Bedawin will describe
as <i>near</i> an object a hundred yards off, or a
well two days' journey from you. Western Ghareeah
was likewise described as <i>grayeb</i>, but we thought
for some time that we had ventured upon an interminable
desert. However, the ground at length
dipped, and a green wady disclosed itself. We
could scarcely, at first, find anybody to receive us.
But after waiting some time, the people came unwillingly
crawling out one after the other. We
told them our errand&mdash;"To look at the country and<a name="page39" id="page39"></a><span class="pageno">[39]</span>
buy barley." They swore they had none&mdash;not a
grain; but when we swore in our turn that we
would pay them for what we wanted, they admitted
having a little that belonged to some people in
Fezzan. I was amused with the eloquent indignation
of our burly chaouch when they professed complete
destitution at first. "You dogs! do you live
on stones?" cried he. This was a settler; and
showed them that they had knowing ones to deal
with. Of course their original shyness arose from
fear lest we might rob them. When a bargain was
struck they became quite friendly, and brought us
out some oil, barley-cakes, and boiled eggs&mdash;all the
luxuries of the oasis!</p>

<p>Ghareeah Gharbeeah stands on the brow of a
limestone rock, on the western side of a valley, which
we had to cross in approaching between date plantations
and a few fields of barley. It was an ancient
Roman city; and there remains still an almost
perfect bas-relief of a Victoria on one side of the
eastern gateway, which is composed of limestone
blocks a foot and a half square. We could trace
also the imperfect letters of a Latin inscription,
together with some Berber characters. The houses
of the present inhabitants are formed of rough blocks
of limestone mixed with mud, and roofed with palm-trunks
and palm-trees. The water resembles that
of the well of Tabooneeah, coming "from the same
rock," as the people say: it is slightly bitter and
saltish.<a name="page40" id="page40"></a><span class="pageno">[40]</span></p>

<p>With the exception of the little valley we had
crossed, nothing could be seen from Ghareeah but
a dreary waste, especially to the south and east. A
tower of modern date rises to the east, on a solitary
rock; and we knew that Eastern Ghareeah was concealed
among the hills at a distance of six hours.
The inhabitants of these secluded towns are called
Waringab, and promise shortly to become extinct.
In this Western Ghareeah there are twenty heads of
families, but very few children,&mdash;scarce sixty souls
altogether; and the population of the other place,
which gives itself airs of metropolitan importance,
is not more than double. How they have not
abandoned the place long ago to jackals and hawks
is a mystery. They do not possess a single camel;
only two or three asses and some flocks of sheep;
and depend, in a great measure, on chance profits
from caravans, for their valley often only affords
provision for a couple of months or so. At intervals,
it is true, when there has been much rain, they sell
barley in the neighbouring valleys; but this season
has been a dry one, and the crop has consequently
fallen short. When they have no barley, they say,
they eat dates; and when the dates are out, they
fast&mdash;a long, continual fast&mdash;and famine takes them
off one by one. The melancholy remnant preserve
traditions of prosperity in comparatively recent
times. Notwithstanding their miserable condition,
however, these wretched people are drained by
taxation of thirty mahboubs per annum&mdash;so many<a name="page41" id="page41"></a><span class="pageno">[41]</span>
drops of blood! The eastern village pays in proportion.
Possibly in a few years this cluster of
wadys may be abandoned to chance Arab visitors,
so that the starting-point for the traverse of the
Hamadah will be removed farther back, perhaps to
Mizdah. There is no life in the civilisation which
claims lordship over these countries unfriended by
nature. The only object of those who wield paramount
authority over them seems to be to extract
money in the most vexatious and expeditious manner.</p>

<p>I purchased of the people of Ghareeah a greyhound
bitch for four Tunisian piastres, so that we
may now expect some hares and gazelles. In returning
to the encampment I observed the phenomenon
of a column of dust carried into the heavens in a
spiral form by the wind, whilst all around was perfectly
calm. Such columns are not of so frequent
occurrence in the desert as is imagined, but from
time to time, as in this instance, are seen.</p>

<p>The evening was spent in making arrangements
with Dr. Barth and Dr. Overweg, who had agreed
to traverse the Hamadah by day, whilst I was to
follow by night, with the blacks. Next morning,
accordingly, the caravan separated into two portions,
and my companions rode slowly away over the
burning desert.</p>

<p>This important day could not be allowed to pass
by my people without a tremendous quarrel. Our
blacks seemed to be in a peculiarly excitable state.
Ali, especially, who has distinguished himself for<a name="page42" id="page42"></a><span class="pageno">[42]</span>
several days in the obstreperous line, has had a
regular turn-to with his father-in-law; and not
satisfied with this, nearly strangled Moknee's son.
The Mandara black threw himself on the ground
and called out,&mdash;"Load my pistol, O Chaouch; I
must shoot this reprobate Ali!"</p>

<p>This fellow is a pest in the caravan, and I have
been obliged to send him off and insist on his return
to Tripoli. He may be brought to his senses
in this way.</p>

<p>The sun was setting as our caravan, which we had
collected in as compact a body as possible, got under
way, and rising out of the valley of Tabooneeah,
began to enter upon the plateau. It is difficult to
convey an idea of the solemn impressions with which
one enters upon such a journey. Everything ahead
is unknown and invested with perhaps exaggerated
terrors by imagination and report. The name of
Desert&mdash;the waterless Desert&mdash;hangs over the horizon,
and suggests the most gloomy apprehensions.
Behind, in the fading light, the trees of the valley
still show their dim groups; before, the lofty level,
slightly broken by undulations, stretches away.
There was one cheering thought, however. My<a name="page44" id="page44"></a><span class="pageno">[44]</span>
companions had by this time set up their tent for
the night; and although, creeping along at the
camel's slow pace, we could not expect to come up
to that temporary home until it was about to be
deserted, still the knowledge of its existence took
away much of the mysterious terror with which I
entered upon this desolate region in the hour of
coming shadows. An additional solemnity was imparted
to the commencement of this arduous journey
by the fact that we now passed the last pillar erected
by the Romans. Their mighty power seems to have
recoiled, as well it might, before the horrid aspect of
the Hamadah.</p>

<p>We pushed on at a steady pace over the rough
ground; and as I surveyed the scene from my
elevated position on the camel's back, I could not
help contrasting this primitive style of travelling
with that with which I had been conversant a few
months before. Instead of whirling along the
summit of an embankment, or through a horizontal
well miles deep, in a machine that always reminded
me of a disjointed dragon, at the rate of some fifty
miles an hour, here I was leisurely swaying to and
fro on the back of the slowest beast that man has
ever tamed, in the midst of a crowd loosely scattered
over the country, some on foot, some in the saddle&mdash;not
seeking to keep any determinate track, but
following a general direction by the light of the
stars, which shine with warm beneficence overhead.
There is no sound to attract the ear, save the<a name="page45" id="page45"></a><span class="pageno">[45]</span>
measured tread of the caravan, the occasional "<i>Isa!
Isa!</i>" of the drivers, the hasty wrench with which our
camels snatch a mouthful of some ligneous plant
that clings to the stony soil, the creaking of the
baggage, or the whistling of the wind that comes
moaning over the desert. These are truly moments
in a man's life to remember; and I shall ever look
back to that solemn night-march over the desert,
which my pen fails to describe, with sentiments of
pleasurable awe.</p>

<p>This night we moved at comparatively a rapid
pace&mdash;nearly three miles an hour; for there was
scarcely any temptation to the camels to linger for
browsing purposes, and the drivers seemed desperately
anxious to get over as much ground as
possible at once. At first all went well enough;
and now and then even, the blacks, who were on
foot, braved the Hamadah with a lively ditty&mdash;celebrating
some Lucy Long of Central Africa. But by
degrees these merry sounds ceased to be heard; and
the hastily-moving crowd of the caravan insensibly
stretched out into a longer line. The poor women
were beginning to knock up, and several fell at times
from mere exhaustion. We proceeded, however,
without stopping, for eleven hours, and after a long,
dreary night indeed, halted at five in the morning,
having reached the encampment of our German
friends.</p>

<p>The dawn soon lighted up the waste, and
enabled us to see that it was a level plain of hard<a name="page46" id="page46"></a><span class="pageno">[46]</span>
red earth, scattered over with pebbles and loose
pieces of limestone mixed with flint.</p>

<p>The Hamadah was very cold in the night, the
wind being from the north. Dr. Overweg does not
think that the plateau is more than fifteen hundred
feet above the level of the sea; but it may be two
thousand, and a little more in some places. By day
it is hot enough; and as there is little to be observed
on these vast, elevated stretches of stony desert, I
thought it best to continue my original plan for
three whole nights.</p>

<p>To spare one's self is the great secret of Saharan
travelling; and there is, after all, not much to observe
in this desolate region.</p>

<p>I should mention, that the second night Ali came
up in a penitent state along with a khafilah from
Ghareeah, and so our poor black women had an
opportunity of getting a lift on the spare camels.
We could, therefore, go on until morning without
fear of losing any of our party in the night. The
position of a person who falls behind a caravan in
the desert very much resembles that of a man overboard.
This khafilah preceded us to Shaty.</p>

<p>After the third night I found the weather so
cool and temperate, that I continued on the whole
of the day; and the Germans joining me in the
evening, we did not again separate. It was
towards the close of the third night that we were
assailed by an awful tempest of wind, rain, and
lightning, which flashed upon us occasionally<a name="page47" id="page47"></a><span class="pageno">[47]</span>
through the thick darkness. The Germans, who
were encamped, had their tents carried away, whilst
we who were in motion found ourselves compelled
to stop and crouch under the bellies of our camels
until the morning broke, and the hurricane had
spent its force. The cold was intense, and our people
complained bitterly. More than once, indeed, the
thermometer was down to freezing-point whilst we
were traversing the plateau; and one morning the
desert was covered with a shining frost.</p>

<p>Although we became accustomed to the desolate
appearance of this district by degrees, we counted
eagerly the days and hours that brought us nearer
the confines of Fezzan. Every night's incidents
were the same. On we went, nodding drowsily
on our camels, sometimes dropping off into a sound
sleep, variegated by a snatch of pleasant dreams.
But these indulgences are dangerous. I was more
than once on the point of falling off. By day, few
objects of interest presented themselves: linnets
and finches fluttered here and there upon the rare
bushes, whilst swallows joined the caravan, and
skimmed round and round for hours among the
camels, almost brushing the faces of the drivers.
Lizards glanced and snakes writhed across the path.
We started three wadan or mouflon, churlish
animals, fond of such solitudes. As to the birds,
our people say they do not drink in winter, and in
summer leave the Hamadah altogether. Four-fifths
of the surface were utterly barren. Little<a name="page48" id="page48"></a><span class="pageno">[48]</span>
mounds marked the graves of children, slaves
who had perished on the way from inner Africa.
The mirage was common, but rarely pretty. Sometimes
ridges of low mountains seemed raised on the
level plain, probably reflected from the cliffs that
edge the plateau. The scattered herbage also
assumed regular forms&mdash;squares, ovals, circles.
Now and then it seemed as if vast ruins were ahead,
but as we drew nigh these dwindled into little
desert-mosques, formed of half-circles of stones, now
turned to the east, now to the west. Here the
faithful who may be obliged to traverse these dreary
regions stop to offer up their simple prayer to the
Almighty Allah, to whom, they say, the dreadful
Hamadah belongs.</p>

<p>The extent of this plateau from north to south,
varying in our route from S.E. to S.W., is about
156 miles, or six long and seven short days' journey.
Sometimes our camels went at the pace of three
miles, but nearly always of two and a-half miles in
the hour. It is almost impossible to make the traverse
in less than fifty-six or sixty hours. The camels
may continue on night and day, but it will always
require so much time to make the weary journey,
which is considered the greatest exploit of Saharan
travelling in this portion of Northern Africa.</p>

<p>On the road to Tuat from Algeria, or to Ghadamez
from Tunis and Tripoli, or to Fezzan from Bonjem
or Benioleed, there is no traverse of six days
comparable in difficulty to that which we have just<a name="page49" id="page49"></a><span class="pageno">[49]</span>
accomplished. There is said to be none other like it
on the road to Soudan, except a tremendous desert
between Gh&acirc;t and Aheer. However, we must not
trouble ourselves about this as yet.</p>

<p>As for the Hamadah, we know that near Sokna
the plateau breaks up and forms what are called the
Jebel-es-Soudy, or Black Mountains, a most picturesque
group of cliffs; and again on the route to
Egypt from Mourzuk, six days' journey south-east
from Sokna, it also breaks into huge cliffs, and bears
the name of El-Harouj. These mountain buttresses
are either the bounds of the Hamadah, or masses of
rock where it breaks into hills, forming ravines or
valleys. But, in fact, how far the Hamadah extends
between Ghadamez on the west and Augila on the
east is not yet properly ascertained. It seems to be
like a broad belt intercepting the progress of commerce,
civilisation, and conquest, from the shores of
the Mediterranean to Central Africa. The kingdom
of Fezzan, however, advances like a promontory
beyond it; and then on every side stretches the
desert ocean with its innumerable oases or islands,
which, from being once mere fluctuating names, as
it were, on a guess map, are now by degrees dropping
one by one into their right places.</p>

<p>On the breaking-up of the plateau we observed
its geological structure to consist of three principal
strata: first, a covering or upper crust, limestone
with flints and red earth; then masses of marl; and
then sandstone, lumps and masses of which were<a name="page50" id="page50"></a><span class="pageno">[50]</span>
blackened by the contact of the air with the iron
they contain. Under the sandstone was likewise a
bed of yellow clay, with a mixture of gypsum.</p>

<p>The face of the cliffs of the plateau was blackened
as with the smoke of a huge furnace, which
gave a majestic and yet gloomy appearance to the
scene as we descended the pass towards the valley
of El-Hasee. We found the plain strewed with great
masses of dark sandstone, seeming to have been detached
by some convulsion from the rocky walls,
which now rose in apparently interminable grandeur
behind us. We glanced back in awe, and yet in some
triumph, towards the iron-bound desert we had thus
safely traversed; but our eyes soon turned from so
bleak a prospect, when we beheld, dotting the sandy
wady, clumps of the wild palm, green copses, and the
majestic ethel-tree.</p>

<p>It was about two in the afternoon when we
reached the camping-ground, all our people shouting,
"<i>Be-Selameh el Hamadah!</i>" Farewell to the
Hamadah! I cried out the same words in a joyful
voice; for, although now that the dangers of the
plateau were overcome they seemed diminished in
my eyes, yet I felt that we had escaped from a most
trying march with wonderful good fortune. It is
difficult to convey an idea of the horror and desolation
of so vast a tract of waterless and uninhabited
country. They alone who have breathed the sharp
air of its blank nakedness can appreciate it, or understand
how any accidental delay, sickness, the<a name="page51" id="page51"></a><span class="pageno">[51]</span>
bursting of the water-skins, the straying of the
camels, might produce incalculable sufferings, and
even death. "<i>Be-Selameh el Hamadah!</i>" then, with
all my heart. "<i>Be-Selameh! be-Selameh!</i>" again
rings through the caravan, as we reach at length
our camping-ground, and throw ourselves at full-length
under the pleasing shade. Even the camel-drivers
were so fatigued, that they stretched out as
soon as the command to halt was given, and let
their animals stray at will, without taking the
trouble to unload them. I had observed the same
supineness during our halts all through this trying
district, which seems to oppress their imaginations as
well as prostrate their bodies. Several times I had
been obliged myself to collect wood and make a fire
to rally our lagging servants. Indeed, on more
than one occasion I was compelled to exert my
personal authority. On the third night, particularly,
I wished all the people to rest one hour. The camel-drivers
resisted this reasonable request, and were
backed by Yusuf. When it became a question between
myself and my interpreter, I jumped off my
camel and stopped the caravan. The chaouch
supported me, and in this case at least behaved very
well. If we had continued all night, we should have
made a march of sixteen hours,&mdash;too much for the
blacks, and indeed for any man on his feet.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, I have to observe, that as
we approach Fezzan our camel-drivers are getting
more civil and obliging. Is this the genial effect of<a name="page52" id="page52"></a><span class="pageno">[52]</span>
native air, or expectation of a present? They have
not mentioned the latter subject yet, but, on the
contrary, promise me some dates.</p>

<p>The broad valley of El-Hasee is sandy, like all
those of Fezzan. It is bounded on the north by the
perpendicular buttresses of the Hamadah, and on the
south by sandy swells. The well is not copious, but
affords a regular supply of slightly brackish water.
The people descend to the bottom, thirty or forty feet,
and fill their gerbahs. The blacks are very troublesome,
and require a good deal of patience. This
morning they would not fetch water from this well,
although quite close by the tent. I was obliged to
threaten to leave them before I could get them to
move. They are, probably, a little broken down by
the fatigue of the Hamadah.</p>

<p>We passed through Wady El-Hasee on the 24th,
and after mid-day began to ascend, and continued
to do so until we pitched tent at half-past four, at
a place called Esfar. This is also a species of plateau,
but consists of sand-hills, sandstone rocks,
and shallow valleys filled with herbage and shrubs.
I was glad to get rid of the eternal limestone and
have a change of the sandstone.</p>

<p>On the 25th we started early, and had a cool
temperature all day. Our chaouch went out, and
by the assistance of the greyhound bitch brought in
a young gazelle. For about three hours the camels
had herbage; but afterwards came a desert more
horrible even than the Hamadah. It consists of<a name="page53" id="page53"></a><span class="pageno">[53]</span>
sandstone rocks, and valleys covered with pebbles
and loose blocks. Some of the rocks are perfectly
black, and would be considered by an European
geologist, on a distant view, as basalt. Until half-past
four in the afternoon we did not see a blade of
grass, a sprig of vegetation, or living thing of any
description; but at the camping-ground was a thin
scattering of herbage, near the foot of the black
mountain called Solaou M&acirc;rrafa.</p>

<p>We have sometimes moral disquisitions among
our people. This day we had a dispute on religion.
The Zintanah, a real orthodox Musulman, maintained
a strict distinction between the believers and
unbelievers, giving heaven to the former and hell to
the latter. Yusuf and several more tolerant gentlemen
held out hope of mercy to us all, as God was
"the Compassionate and the Merciful." The chaouch
also lectured the people on courage, and publicly
maintained that the Fezzanees were all cowards.
This fellow is a second Sir John Falstaff, without
the corpulence. The tone of all members of the
caravan, as I have mentioned, is now much humanised.
Every one is more civil to us, and, by
habit, to one another. However, the chaouches must,
of course, get up a quarrel now and then: they do
it between themselves; but, as a sign that they likewise
are a little civilised, have only had two regular
explosions to-day. Probably these worthies, who
remind me of a bull-dog and a terrier, find particular
pleasure in this form of social intercourse; for<a name="page54" id="page54"></a><span class="pageno">[54]</span>
I always observe, that they are on more friendly terms
than ever after they have almost come to beard-pulling.</p>

<p>I interfere as little as possible in all these quarrels,
but now and then it is difficult to hold aloof.
This morning, for example, the black who has two
wives, took it into his head to beat one of them in
public. I called upon him to desist, upon which he
went to work harder than ever; so that I was compelled
to break a stick over his shoulders to reduce
him to quietness. These little caravan incidents
were often the only ones that diversified our day.</p>

<p>On the 26th, after a march of ten hours, with
cool weather at first, but suffocating heat afterwards,
we reached Edree, a town of El-Shaty, in a state of
great exhaustion. During the latter part of the
march, however, we had been cheered by the sight
of the town, which stands on a small mound of
yellow clay and rock. The whitewashed marabout
of Bou Darbalah gleamed a little distance in front
of the place, which in itself is now a heap of ruins,
having been destroyed by Abd-el-Galeel, on account
of the resistance of the inhabitants to his usurped
authority. He also, with a cruelty rarely practised
in Saharan warfare, cut down above a thousand
palms; thus rendering it impossible for the place
to recover rapidly from its disasters. Previously
there had been a hundred and twenty heads of
families; now there are only twenty-five, and these
are still diminishing it is said. However, many<a name="page55" id="page55"></a><span class="pageno">[55]</span>
little children are now in the streets, naked, and
covered with filth.</p>

<p>These few inhabitants are a mixed race, some
being as fair as those on the coast, whilst others are
as black as the darkest negroes of Central Africa.
The Sheikh and two or three patriarchs of the village
were polite and hospitable, and showed every disposition
to comply with the orders sent by the Pasha
of Mourzuk to supply us with fresh provisions without
payment. I accepted a sheep and two fowls;
but the dates for our blacks I paid for, and added a
few presents.</p>

<p>The valley of Edree is very shallow, and this
portion of it is mostly covered with bushes of wild
palm and with coarse herbage; it looks green and
grateful amidst the surrounding aridity. There are
still remaining many fruit-bearing date-trees&mdash;about
seven thousand, scattered at great distances. The
water is good, although the surface of the valley is
in parts covered with a whitish crust of salt. Some
large springs are continually overflowing with bubbles
of gas, like the great well of Ghadamez.</p>

<p>In the garden-fields of Edree are cultivated
wheat and barley, the former white and of the finest
quality. A good deal of grain has already been got
in this year. With industry, and a few more animals
to draw the water for irrigation, a great quantity of
wheat might be grown in this oasis. The gardens
contain also a few figs and grapes. Doves were
fluttering in the branches of the palms, and swallows<a name="page56" id="page56"></a><span class="pageno">[56]</span>
darting through their waving foliage. There were
thousands of native flies here, besides those that had
come with us. When we complained, we were
answered, "This is a country of dates!"</p>

<p>Shaty has eighteen districts, some very limited,
but having date-palms, and paying contributions to
Mourzuk. Edree, itself, is drained of four hundred
mahboubs per annum.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;I rose at sunrise and went to see the
ancient dwellings of Edree, where the people lived
underground: they are excavations out of the rock,
some fifty yards from the surface beneath the
modern town. The entrances are choked with sand,
and they are not entered by the people, who say
"They are the abodes of serpents." At present,
there is nothing remarkable about them. Probably
they were originally natural caves, which were enlarged
and arranged as dwellings.</p>

<p>On returning to the encampment, I found that
the Ka&iuml;d, or commander of the troops of the Shaty
district, had arrived with some Arab cavaliers: he
has in all thirty horsemen. Our visitors offered to
"play powder" in order to do us honour; but were
compelled to beg us to supply the ammunition. It
was a very animating scene, after the dreary journey
over the Fezzanee deserts. A dozen mounted cavaliers
dashed to and fro, shaking the earth, scouting
and firing from time to time. Everybody enjoyed
it; even the half-naked, dirty, brown-black ladies
of the town, stopped with their water-jugs, and<a name="page57" id="page57"></a><span class="pageno">[57]</span>
looked on with satisfaction. The Ka&iuml;d was the best
man of his men; but Yusuf afterwards dressed and
beat the victor, riding with great dexterity, and attracting
the spontaneous applause of all the spectators.
The Ka&iuml;d trembled whilst contending with
Yusuf, who was set down as a marabout in consequence
by our chaouch.</p>

<p>I gave the Ka&iuml;d, who was a mild and respectful
man, a handkerchief, a little bit of writing-paper,
and some soap, and sent him off to his station,
whence he had come on purpose to visit us. Three
handkerchiefs formed also an appropriate present to
the Sheikhs of Edree.</p>

<p>Yusuf has been reading an Arabic book, which I
at first thought was some commentary on the Koran;
but to-day I was undeceived. He related what he
read; it reminded me of Gulliver's Travels. A tall
man walks through the sea, cooks fish in the sun, and
destroys a whole town, whose inhabitants had insulted
him, by the same means that our comparative giant
saved the palace of Lilliput from conflagration.</p>

<p>This evening it was announced as an event that
the Zintanah, a servant of the Germans, was going
to Tripoli, having resolved to return home. Some
said one thing about him, some another; but most,
"He's afraid of the fever of Mourzuk." The fellow
came afterwards to me, asking for letters to Tripoli.
I told him to go about his business; that he was a
man of words and had no heart, otherwise he would<a name="page58" id="page58"></a><span class="pageno">[58]</span>
continue with us to Mourzuk. I wished to discourage
such acts of desertion, for they produce
always a bad effect. My German companions
seemed glad to get rid of him.</p>

<p>We started again on Sunday morning (the 28th).
This was our first day of sand. We had almost forgotten
that there was such a thing as sand in the
desert; but we shall have two days more of the
same kind of travelling, to keep us in mind of this
unpleasant truth. However, we were glad enough
to leave Edree. Our marabout, comparing this
place with El-Wady, for which we are now journeying,
says, "Edree is like a jackass; El-Wady is
like a camel!" Yusuf calls Edree "the city of
camel-bugs." These vermin are the leeches of the
camels. During the morning we passed two or
three forests of palms, and afterwards traversed a
flat valley, where was a little herbage. The people
said; "There is no tareek (track): the tareek is in
our heads." Bou Keta noted the route in many
parts by the presence of camels' dung; but the
shape of the sand-hills in these parts seems to be
perfectly familiar to these men. We saw one or
two lizards, but no birds or other signs of life, except
two brown-black Fezzanees, trudging over the
desert.</p>

<p>At four in the afternoon, after a day of hot wind,
we encamped in Wady Guber, where there is water
two or three feet below the surface; and a small<a name="page59" id="page59"></a><span class="pageno">[59]</span>
forest of palms belonging to our camel-drivers,
having descended to them in small groups from
their grandfathers.</p>

<p>Next day (29th) we again went on over the sand,
which extends beyond Ghadamez and Souf, to the
west, and even to Egypt on the east. It is met at
different points by the khafilahs, and crossed in different
numbers of days. We found it very hard
work to cross it, and understood why, in these parts,
the words <i>raml</i>, sand, and <i>war</i>, difficult, have become
convertible terms. Bou Keta had considerable
trouble in keeping to the route, being reduced
to depend chiefly on the camels' dung, which rolls
about the surface of the sand. Here and there was
a patch of coarse herbage, scattered like black spots
on the bright, white surface. Every object was very
much magnified at a little distance; I saw what
seemed to me to be a horse on the top of one of the
hills, but on drawing near it proved to be our own
greyhound bitch smelling the hot air.</p>

<p>Bou Keta gave some account of himself to-day.
It seems that "Fezzanee" is not a very respectable
epithet in those countries.</p>

<p>"I am not a Fezzanee," said Bou Keta, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Then what are you?"</p>

<p>"My mother was a Tuarick woman, and my
father one of the Walad Suleiman."</p>

<p>"Then the Walad Suleiman are gentlemen,
whilst the Fezzanees are Turks and dogs?"</p>

<p>"That's the truth," quoth he.<a name="page60" id="page60"></a><span class="pageno">[60]</span></p>

<p>To-day I found the veil of my sister-in-law of
essential service. Doubled, it shielded my eyes
perfectly from the hot wind and sand. It serves
also as an excellent protection for the eyes against
the flies whilst I am writing. This is the second
day of the hot wind. In the evening we heard
crickets singing in the scorching sand. At mid-day
the thermometer, when buried, rose to 122&deg; Fahr.
We encamped in Wady El-Makmak, where we
had good water, far superior to that at Guber. As
in nearly all sandy places, a hole is scooped in the
sand and then covered over, or left to be filled by
the action of the wind after the khafilah is supplied.
Two pretty palms point, as with two fingers,
to the buried wells of El-Makmak.</p>

<p>Some of our people noticed the lizard to-day.
This seems to be the omnipresent animal of the
Sahara, inhabiting its most desolate regions when
no other living creature is seen. It changes in
species with the nature of the country. To-day,
those seen are large; very soon they will become
small, meagre, and will change colour. In the
valleys I have observed them nearly the same
colour as the sandy soil. Perhaps the beetle is
nearly as common as the lizard in the desert, being
found in its most arid and naked wastes. It is
generally a big, round, black-bottle beetle, which
produces a trail in the sand that may be mistaken
for that of the serpent.</p>

<p>Still the following day we had to cross the same<a name="page61" id="page61"></a><span class="pageno">[61]</span>
kind of desert, under the enervating influence of
the gheblee, or hot wind; the thermometer in the
sand reached 130&deg;. Although the camels were eight
hours on foot, little progress was made. I stopped
an hour to rest in Wady El-Jumar, where were two
or three palm-groves. One of the Fezzanees ferreted
out a lot of dates, hidden in the sand, and taking
some distributed them amongst us.</p>

<p>Thus refreshed we pushed on to encamp in Wady
El-Takadafah, where there is a well of water, good
to drink, but disagreeable in smell, like that of
Bonjem. The odour resembles that of a sewer, and
is produced by hydrogen of sulphur. We have had
good water every day in this sandy tract, and I have
no doubt that some may be found in every wady,
a little below the surface. Birds begin now to reappear:
a few swallows, a dove, and some small
twitterers, were seen to give life to the otherwise
melancholy wadys.</p>

<p>Dr. Overweg examined the sand, which rolled
in great heaps on every side, and found it to consist
of grains of four kinds,&mdash;white, yellow, red, and
black; the latter colour caused by the presence of
iron. These variegated sands form the basis of sandstone,
and may be a decomposition of sandstone.
The sand near Tripoli is of a finer sort, consisting
mostly of a decomposition of limestone. There is
a blue-black earth in the wadys, arising from the
wood, a species of crumbling coal.</p>

<p>This evening we had a famous <i>embroglio</i> between<a name="page62" id="page62"></a><span class="pageno">[62]</span>
our chaouch and the marabout. The latter
had caught a waran, or large species of lizard, and
skinned it to dispose of the skin. The chaouch impudently
swore he had been eating the flesh of the
reptile&mdash;a direful accusation. A tremendous war of
words ensued; and not of words only, for presently
the holy man came in for a gratification of ropes'
end. All the Fezzanees rushed forward to save the
honour of the marabout; and the chaouch retreated
to my tent in search of arms. A stupid joke was
on the point of leading to murder. I interfered,
and succeeded in appeasing the storm in some degree.
I then rated the chaouch soundly for beating
a man invested with a sacred character in the eyes
of all Musulmans. This produced a good effect,
and the culprit, hanging his head, seemed ashamed
of the part he had played. Subsequently he kissed
the hand of the holy man, and they were reconciled.</p>

</div>

<p>On the 1st of May we had an arduous piece of
work to perform. The khafilah was in motion fourteen
entire hours, over heavy sand, with the hot
wind breathing fiercely upon it. No amateur walking
was indulged in. Every one kept sullenly to
his camel; and those who were obliged to advance
on foot dragged slowly along, seeming every moment
as if they were about to abandon all exertion
in despair, and lie down to perish. Our course lay
mostly south, as usual; but varied occasionally from
south-east to south-west. The scene was one of the
most singular that could be imagined. Camels and
men were scattered along the track, treading slowly
but continually forward, and yet not seeming to advance<a name="page64" id="page64"></a><span class="pageno">[64]</span>
at all. Instead of the cheering cry of "<i>Isa!
Isa!</i>" which urges on the burdened beasts over rocky
deserts, the dull, prolonged sound of "<i>Thurr! Thurr!</i>"
was substituted. Beyond this there was no noise.
The men had no strength to talk or to sing, and
the tread of many feet awaken no echo in the sandy
waste. Waves of red and yellow, or of dazzling
whiteness, swelled round in a circle of ever-varying
diameter as we rose and fell. Here and there
stretched great stains of black herbage. Every
object is magnified and changed to the eye. The
heat and the swinging motion of the camel produce
a slight dizziness, and the outer world assumes a
hazy indistinctness of outline&mdash;something like dream-landscapes.
There is a desert-intoxication which
must be felt to be appreciated.</p>

<p>We must not, however, libel even the Sandy Desert,
by producing the impression that it is all barren
and comfortless. Though far more difficult to
travel over than the Hamadah, it possesses the inestimable
advantage of having water every day once
at least. A little after noon, indeed, we passed two
lakes; one small, and the other of considerable dimensions,
containing sweet water, and bordered by
a fringe of palm-trees. At times there is very good
herbage for the camels. The most frequent shrub
on which they browse is the <i>resou</i>, which has small
ears of grain, eaten also by men as food. Traces
of animal life, as I have observed, are few; but we
saw this day two broken ostrich-eggs. How they<a name="page65" id="page65"></a><span class="pageno">[65]</span>
came there it is difficult to say: no traces or footmarks
have been remarked.</p>

<p>At length I had begun to find drinking a necessity.
During these days of sand I imbibed more
than during the whole of the rest of the journey.
The eating of dates added to my thirst; and the
blacks complained of the same thing. Dates are
much better in the winter, and keep the cold out of
the stomach; but I should recommend all Saharan
travellers to eat as few of them as possible, at any
season of the year.</p>

<p>During this last day, beyond the expanse of
sandy waves through which we swam, as it were,
had risen ahead some very conspicuous mountains.
Even at five in the morning we could see detached
along the line of the horizon the highest and most
advanced portion of the edge of the plateau of
Mourzuk. In three hours the white line of cliffs
came in view, looking like a stretch of black-blue sea,
contrasting strangely with the sparkling white-sand
undulations that stretched to their feet. Some of us
thought that an inland sea&mdash;never before heard of&mdash;had
rolled its waters athwart our path, so perfect was
the illusion. The heavens, this day particularly, attracted
our attention. What a sky! how beautiful!
The ground was a soft, light azure; and on its
mildly resplendent surface were scattered loosely
about some downy, feathery clouds, of the purest
white&mdash;veils manufactured in celestial looms!</p>

<p>We expected to reach our premeditated halting<a name="page66" id="page66"></a><span class="pageno">[66]</span>
ground about noon, or before, these cliffs seeming so
near. But as day wore on, new expanses of glittering
desert seemed to stretch out before us; and every
hillock gained disclosed only the existence of new
hillocks ahead. Meanwhile the hot wind still blew
with unremitting violence, scorching our faces, and
penetrating to the inmost recesses of our frames.
The poor blacks, who were on foot, gazed wistfully
ahead, and ever and anon called to those who were
nodding on the camels, as if stunned by the heat, to
tell them if they might hope for rest. I found my
eyesight dimming, and deafness coming on. The
thermometer was plunged into the sand, and the
mercury instantly mounted to above 130&deg;.</p>

<p>At length we sighted the wady, stretching like
a green belt between the sand and the mountains
beyond. We found that we had been traversing an
elevated swell of the desert, for we were full three
quarters of an hour descending to the level of the
valley.</p>

<p>The first specimen of inhabitants we saw on arriving
was a group of naked children with their
mother, who covered herself up in her barracan on
our approach. The children were nearly all females,
and even those of not more than three or four years
of age seemed wonderfully developed. They had
formed a house out of a thick bush of wild palms
over the well.</p>

<p>These people are what are called Tuaricks of
Fezzan. They are a dwarfish, slim race; and the<a name="page67" id="page67"></a><span class="pageno">[67]</span>
Fezzanees call them <i>their</i> Arabs. They cover up
their faces like their kindred of Gh&acirc;t, but have for
the most part white <i>thelems</i> instead of black. A
few sport a red fotah, or turban. They speak Arabic
commonly, but some know also the language of
Gh&acirc;t; which fact connects them certainly with that
country. Their proper name is Tanelkum, a genuine
Tuarick word, and decisive of their Targhee origin.
Their trade is chiefly camel-driving between Gh&acirc;t
and Fezzan. They are a fairer and finer race than
the Fezzanees, and do not intermarry with them.
Their numbers are not great, perhaps scarcely more
than a thousand souls in all Fezzan; but they live
in a state of entire independence, and pay no contributions
to the Porte.</p>

<p>We passed the first well and came up with the
true Fezzanees at the village of Laghareefah, where
we encamped. It is situated in Wady Gharbee,
more properly called El-Wady <i>par excellence</i>, on
account of its superior fertility and culture. There
is also Wady Sherky, and several others; as Etsaou,
Akar, Um-el-Hamm&acirc;m, Takruteen, and Aujar. The
people of Laghareefah are all of a black-brown hue,
and some had the ordinary negro features. They
were a little rude at first, but made some compensation
in the evening by sending us a good supply
of meat and fresh bread to our tents.</p>

<p>To our surprise, we saw nothing of our chaouches
here; and on making inquiries, we found that they
were not with the caravan. They were known to<a name="page68" id="page68"></a><span class="pageno">[68]</span>
have pushed on ahead, impatient to arrive. We suspected
they had taken the wrong route, and did
not remember to have seen the track of their horses'
hoofs on the sand as we advanced. At first we were
not sorry that they were suffering a little for their
bad conduct all the way from Tripoli, to which I have
only made passing allusions. But then we began to
be alarmed for their safety, and begged the Sheikh
to send a man after them with water. They did not
make their appearance until morning, when we
learned that with immense fatigue they had succeeded
in striking the valley lower down at another
village, where they had tarried the remainder of the
night. As might be expected, they were in no good
humour after their excursion in the sand; but our
people, who had enjoyed a brief respite of unwonted
tranquillity during their absence, instead of condoling
with them, received them with laughter and
jeers.</p>

<p>The Sheikh Abd-el-Hady sent us breakfast, and
he and his people were far more polite than yesterday.
We learned that there was a caravan in the
wady about to start for Gh&acirc;t, and I took the opportunity
to write to that place to produce a proper
impression of our views and intentions, as I learned
that a very erroneous one had gone abroad. The
Sheikh and his elders came to ask me to <i>lend</i> them
twelve mahboubs, to make up the amount of tribute
now being collected by the agents of the Pasha of
Mourzuk. Of course I did not consent, representing<a name="page69" id="page69"></a><span class="pageno">[69]</span>
that I was at the outset of a long journey, and
that the Pasha would certainly punish them if he
ever heard that such a request had been made.
As a solace for the disappointment, I gave the Sheikh
three handkerchiefs and a pocket-knife. The Tuaricks
came in for a little soap, an article seemingly
in universal request.</p>

<p>El-Wady is a deep valley, lying like a moat
between the elevated sandy desert and the plateau
on which Mourzuk is situated. This plateau, at the
distance of every few miles, juts out huge buttresses
of perpendicular cliffs, which frown over the broken
thread of green vegetation in the valley. Thick
forests of palms stretch at various points along the
low plain, where are springs plentifully furnished by
filtration from the high ground on either hand. The
various kinds of oasian culture are pursued here with
success. Wheat and barley are produced in considerable
quantities; and camels, asses, and goats find
plentiful nourishment. The villages are numerous;
but some contain only few men, and none exceed
forty-five. Takarteebah, the largest place, pays four
hundred and ninety mahboubs per annum, cultivates
four thousand palms, yielding a hundred and fifty
kafasses of dates, thirty of wheat, and eight of barley;
it feeds eleven asses. I observed that all domestic
animals, the goats especially, attain a very
diminutive size in these oases, the nourishment for
them being but scanty.</p>

<p>In this oasis the palm-groves are much more<a name="page70" id="page70"></a><span class="pageno">[70]</span>
dense than in any other I have seen. They almost
merit the name of forests, both from their size and
wild luxuriant appearance. The Fezzanees pay little
attention to their culture, and when a tree falls it is
frequently suffered to lie for months, even though
it block up the public road. In contrast to the
burning desert we had just traversed, these dense
woods casting their shadows on the white sand produced
a most pleasing effect. We eagerly wandered
into the cool arcades, and watched with
delight the doves and hippoes, and other birds, as
they fluttered to and fro amidst the drooping leaves.</p>

<p>Laghareefah, like Edree, had been destroyed by
the brilliant, though ruthless usurper, Abd-el-Galeel,
on account of its resistance to his authority.
The old town is at a little distance from the new,
and was evidently a much better-built place, commanded
by an earthen kasr or fortress.</p>

<p>On May 2d, we had a tempest of thunder and
lightning to the south on the hills, produced by the
intense heat of the morning, and its accumulation
during the previous few days. Rain seemed to be
falling at a distance of a few hours. In the evening
the mercury still stood about 100&deg;. The heat now
was still very distressing. The wind came charged
with dust that rolled in columns, like smoke beaten
down by a tempest, across the surface of the valley.
All the vegetation seemed withered, as if in an oven;
and the wheat in the ear was brittle, as though
roasted. There is a good deal of wheat in this<a name="page71" id="page71"></a><span class="pageno">[71]</span>
oasis. I observed an old woman reaping, and went
to chat with her. Her sickle had a long handle,
and the blade itself was narrow, but slightly bent
and somewhat serrated. I tried it, and found that
it answered its purpose very well, however rude in
appearance.</p>

<p>I entered one of the huts made of palm-branches,
and carelessly smeared with mud&mdash;an attempt at
plastering that can hardly be called successful. The
door was formed of rough planks of date-wood,
and the flooring of hard-trodden earth, covered with
mats. The principal article of furniture was, as
usual, the small hand corn-mill, for nearly every
person in the East is still his own miller. The huts,
though rude in outward appearance, were dark,
cool, and comfortable within. In the town itself,
many of them are built entirely of mud; that is to say,
of round mud balls, first moistened with water, and
then dried in the sun. I entered several, and found
that most were empty. Where we found people,
they were courteous and cheerful in manners, and
smiled at the curiosity with which I lifted up the
wicker covers of their pots and jars. In one I found
a little sour milk; in another, some bazeen; in another,
a few dates soaking in water. A small vessel
now and then occurred, full of oil; but this is the
greatest luxury they possess.</p>

<p>None of the doors has either lock or key. The
Fezzanee observed, "Strangers may steal, but Fezzanees
never. All the dates remain securely on the<a name="page72" id="page72"></a><span class="pageno">[72]</span>
trees until gathered by the owners." It must be
observed, however, that the anomaly of vast possessions
being held by one man, who can scarcely
consume or utilise the produce, whilst others have
not a stone whereon to lay their heads, and depend
even for a burial-place upon charity, is not to be
observed in this barbarous country.</p>

<p>The children of the Wady, up to the age of seven
or eight years, go about perfectly naked, which may
partly account for the bronze-black colour of their
skins. The Tuaricks are generally fairer than the
Fezzanees, though some of these latter are fair as
the Moors on the coast, whilst others are black as
very niggers.</p>

<p>We received a visit from the Nather, or civil
governor of the Wady. He is a Fezzanee, Abbas
by name; and thankfully received the present of a
handkerchief. The Ka&iuml;d, or military commander,
is a Moor from Tripoli. Everybody seems interested
about us, and there is a perfect flux of visits.
All the authorities around seem to make our arrival
a holiday. We are quite the fashion. The chaouch
gets drunk in the evening on leghma, furnished by
the Nather, who wants to worm out all the news; and
there is little doubt that he has learned the whole
truth, and a good deal more. El-Maskouas, the
Turkish officer employed in collecting contributions
for Mourzuk, arrived at the camp and brought letters
from M. Gagliuffi. He also told us that the Sheikh
of Aghadez had not yet returned from his pilgrimage<a name="page73" id="page73"></a><span class="pageno">[73]</span>
to Mekka. The motions of all these desert
magnates are circulated from mouth to mouth as assiduously
as those of our Mayfair fashionables.</p>

<p>Among our visitors was Haj Mohammed El-Saeedy,
the owner of our camels. His social position
answers to that of an English shipowner. He
is a marabout of great celebrity in this country,
and moves about in an atmosphere of respect. By
the way, when it became clearly impressed upon
my mind that the Fezzanee camel-drivers were merely
employed for hire, and had no property whatever in
the beasts they drove, my opinion of them began to
rise. It would have been impossible to take more
care of the camels than they did.</p>

<p>We remained stationary in the Wady, from the 1st
of May to the evening of the 3d, when we moved
on to Toueewah. After dark was passed Azerna, in
the neighbourhood of which stood the ancient town,
celebrated for its ruins. The modern place, though
presenting a martial kind of appearance with its battlemented
mud walls, contained only ten inhabitants,
who live like so many rats in holes or under the
piles of ruins. On the 4th, when the people removed
our beds in the morning, a scorpion sallied
furiously forth. We had been sleeping with him
under our pillows. We moved on, still in the Wady,
for a couple of hours, until we came to the house of
the Ka&iuml;d, and once more encamped. His habitation
is large, commodious, and well protected from the
sun. He showed us his sleeping-apartment, which<a name="page74" id="page74"></a><span class="pageno">[74]</span>
is airy and well protected from the sun. A number
of little wicker baskets, the handiwork of his wife,
served as so many clothes-presses. The baskets of
Fezzan are perfectly water-tight.</p>

<p>This Ka&iuml;d, called Ahmed Tylmoud, is quite a character,
and looks very droll with his single eye. He
has twenty soldiers only under his command throughout
the valley. The Turks do not waste their men,
making up by severity for want of numbers. Like
the commandant of Shaty, this Ahmed Tylmoud
insisted on "playing at powder" with his men
for our edification; but was also obliged to beg his
ammunition. It is singular, that although these
people are only armed with matchlocks, and are
supposed to be ready for service, either to defend
the country or levy contributions, they seem entirely
destitute of all necessary provisions for that
purpose.</p>

<p>We were pestered with two very modest requests,
which were not in our power to grant. In the first
place, the native inhabitants sent a deputation to
ask us to use our influence with the Governor of
Mourzuk to procure a reduction of their taxes; and
then the Arab troops desired that we should procure
for them their discharge. Our refusal even to take
the charge of these verbal petitions seemed very
harsh. An impression had evidently got abroad
that we came to bring about a general redress of
grievances; or, at any rate, that our influence was
far greater than we chose to avow.<a name="page75" id="page75"></a><span class="pageno">[75]</span></p>

<p>I gave to the Ka&iuml;d a handkerchief, as well as
some snuff and tobacco. In return, he sent a little
bread and a fly-flapper; so that we parted good
friends. During our stay, we heard this jolly fellow
entertaining the chaouches and his own horsemen
with a description of the ladies of the Wady, who
had no reason to be flattered by his account. And
yet he seems to have married one himself: <i>hinc
ill&aelig; lachrym&aelig;</i>, perhaps. My chaouch had already
given me a confirmation of these libels, and was
evidently greatly delighted by this testimony to his
exactitude.</p>

<p>There are several roads from the Wady to Mourzuk,
all much about the same distance. It is said,
also, that Gh&acirc;t is only ten days from Laghareefah.
We moved on a little further on the evening of the
4th, but did not start properly until next day, when
we made a long stretch of more than thirteen hours,
and encamped at the village of Agar, where I remembered
having halted once before on my way
from Gh&acirc;t. During this day's march we found,
that what we had supposed to be the border of the
Mourzuk plateau was not in reality so. We soon
reached the summit of the cliffs, and having cast
back a glance upon the valley, with its expanse of
corn-fields and thousands of palm-trees, expected to
find an elevated plateau beyond; but the hills gradually
softened down into a plain on their eastern
side. Our route may be said to have led through a
wilderness, not a desert. On all sides were clusters of<a name="page76" id="page76"></a><span class="pageno">[76]</span>
the tholukh, which grows prettily up, and has a poetical
appearance. The ground at some places was strewed
with branches, cut down for the goats to feed on.
Then we came to a small wady full of <i>resou</i>, which
our marabout calls the "meat of the camel;"
and all the camels at once stopped, and for a long
time obstinately refused to proceed. This appeared
strange to us, but on inquiry we found that the
sagacious brutes remembered perfectly well that
until the evening there would be no herbage so
good, and were determined to have their fill whilst
there was an opportunity. The drivers, after indulging
them a few moments, took them in flank, and
their shouts of "<i>Isa! Isa!</i>" and some blows, at length
got the caravan out of this elysium of grass into
the hungry plain beyond. As we proceeded, a cold
bracing wind began to blow from the east, and considerably
chilled our frames. I had met the same
weather four years previously. Towards evening,
however, it became warmer, as it usually does. The
country was bare and level, like an expanse of dull-coloured
water; and the palm-trees that cluster
near the village rose slowly above the horizon as we
drew nigh. The sun had gone down, and the
plain stretched dim and shadowy around before we
came in sight of the group of hovels which form the
village. As I looked back, the scattered camels
slowly toiling along could be faintly traced against
the horizon.</p>

<p>The Sheikh of Agar received us well this time,<a name="page77" id="page77"></a><span class="pageno">[77]</span>
sending us two fowls and supper for our people.
This place consists of huts made of palm-branches
and of mud hovels, several of which are in ruins.
The same remark constantly recurs in reference to
almost all the towns of Barbary, both towards the
coast and far in the interior. The vital principle
of civilisation seems to have exhausted itself in those
parts.</p>

<p>I was now in a country comparatively familiar to
me, and knew that I had but one more ride to
reach the capital of Fezzan. Rising early on the
6th, therefore, I determined to press on in advance of
the caravan; and starting with warm weather, puffs
of wind coming now from the south-east, now from
the north-west, very unsteadily&mdash;the atmosphere
was slightly murky, with sand flying about&mdash;I soon
came in sight of the palm-groves of Mourzuk, without
making any other rencontre than a Tuarick
coursing over the desert in full costume. The old
castle peeped picturesquely through the trees, but I
had still a good way to go before reaching shelter.
The sand and white earth that form the surface of
the oasis near the town were painfully dazzling to
my eyes.</p>

<p>At length I reached the suburbs, where a few
people stared curiously at me. My arrival had
been announced by the chaouches, who had gone
on about a quarter of an hour before; and at the
eastern gate the soldiers allowed me to pass without
notice, or any allusion to <i>gumruk</i>. Mr. Gagliuffi<a name="page78" id="page78"></a><span class="pageno">[78]</span>
had come out to meet me; but having taken
a different gate we crossed, and I arrived on my
camel at his house, and found it empty. My veil
being down in the streets I was recognised by no
one. The acting Governor had arranged to meet
me with twenty horsemen, but I had taken them
all quite unawares. The letters forwarded requesting
us to make a halt in the suburbs, and then advance
slowly in "holiday costume," for the sake of
effect, had not reached me. However, they had
hoisted the Ottoman flag on the castle, in honour of
our expected arrival,&mdash;a compliment that had not
before been paid to strangers, and one never offered
at Tripoli.</p>

<p>Our German friends arrived shortly afterwards,
and we all had a very hospitable reception from
Mr. Gagliuffi, with whom we lodged. A few calls
were made upon us in the evening, but we were
glad enough to seek our beds. Next day the chief
people of the city, the Kady and other dignitaries,
began early to visit us. When we had exchanged
compliments with them, we went in full European
dress to wait on the acting Pasha. We found him
to be a very quiet, unassuming man, who gave us
a most kind and gentlemanlike reception, equal
to anything of the kind of Tripoli. He is a Turk,
and recognised me as having been before at Mourzuk.
We had coffee, pipes, and sherbet made of
oranges. Afterwards we visited the Treasurer, who
also gave us coffee, and was very civil; and finally<a name="page79" id="page79"></a><span class="pageno">[79]</span>
called upon the brother of the Governor of Gh&acirc;t,
who was writing letters for us to-day.</p>

<p>I feel in better health than when I left Tripoli.
Yet we are all a little nervous about the climate of
Mourzuk, which is situated in a slight depression
of the plain, in a place inclined to be marshy. The
Consul has just recovered from a severe illness.</p>

<p>We had been, in all, thirty-nine days from Tripoli,
a considerable portion of which time was spent in
travelling. This makes a long journey; but I am
told that our camel-drivers should have brought us
by way of Sebha, and thus effected a saving of three
or four days. The greater portion of our sandy
journey was unnecessary, and merely undertaken
that these gentlemen might have an opportunity of
visiting their wives and families.</p>

<p>On a retrospective view of the route from Tripoli
to Mourzuk, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Mizdah, I am inclined to divide the
country, for convenience sake, into a series of zones,
or regions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1st zone. This includes the sandy flat of the
suburbs of the town of Tripoli, with the date-palm
plantations and the sand-hills contiguous.</p>

<p>2d zone. The mountains, or Tripoline Atlas,
embracing the rising ground with their influence
on the northern side, and the olive and fig plantations,
covering the undulating ground on the southern
side, where the Barbary vegetation is seen in all its
vigour and variety. This may also be emphatically
called the region of rain.<a name="page80" id="page80"></a><span class="pageno">[80]</span></p>

<p>3d zone. The limestone hills and broad valleys,
gradually assuming the aridity of the Sahara as
you proceed southward, between the town of Kaleebah
and Ghareeah; the olive plantations and corn-fields
disappear, entirely in this tract.</p>

<p>4th zone. The Hamadah, an immense desert
plateau, separating Tripoli from Fezzan.</p>

<p>5th zone. The sandy valleys and limestone rocks
between El-Hasee and Es-Shaty, where herbage and
trees are found, affording food to numerous gazelles,
hares, and the wadan.</p>

<p>6th. The sand between Shaty and El-Wady,
piled in masses, or heaps, extending in undulating
plains, and occasionally opening in small valleys
with herbage and trees.</p>

<p>7th. The sandy valleys of El-Wady, covered
with forests of date-palms, through which peep a
number of small villages.</p>

<p>8th. The plateau of Mourzuk, consisting of shallow
valleys, ridges of low sandstone hills, and naked
flats, or plains, sometimes of sand, at others covered
with pebbles and small stones.</p>
</div>

<p>All these zones beyond the Atlas are visited by
only occasional showers, or are entirely without rain,
the vegetation depending upon irrigation from wells.
I do not go into further detail on this subject, because,
although our line of route was new, this stretch
of country is tolerably well known to the geographical
reader.</p>

<p>I have omitted to mention, or to lay much stress<a name="page81" id="page81"></a><span class="pageno">[81]</span>
on the fact, that we were unable to procure sufficient
camels at Tripoli to convey our goods all the way to
Mourzuk. We were compelled to leave three
camel-loads behind, in the first place, at Gharian;
these were subsequently got on to Kaleebah, and
thence to Mizdah: but there the influence of Izhet
Pasha's circular letter entirely failed to procure for
us three extra camels, and we were compelled to push
on to Mourzuk, leaving part of our goods in the
oasis. This circumstance caused me a great deal of
annoyance, both on the route and after our arrival, for
it was a long time before we got in all our baggage.
However, it at last arrived, and the delay only
served to illustrate the difficulty of procuring conveyance
in these dismal countries, and to lead us
into considerable expense.</p>

</div>

<p>The Pashalic of Fezzan, although it occupies a
considerable space upon the map&mdash;advancing like
a peninsula from the line of Barbary countries
into the Sahara&mdash;is in reality a very insignificant
province. From all that I can learn, its entire population
does not exceed twenty-six thousand souls,
scattered about in little oases over a vast extent of
country. It is, in fact, a portion of the Sahara, in
which fertile valleys occur a little more frequently
than in the other portions. Immense deserts, sometimes
perfectly arid, but at others slightly sprinkled
with herbage, separate these valleys; and are periodically
traversed by caravans, great and small,
which in the course of time have covered the country
with a perfect network of tracks.<a name="page83" id="page83"></a><span class="pageno">[83]</span></p>

<p>Fezzan is divided into ten districts, of which the
principal is El-Hofrah, containing the capital,
Mourzuk, and several smaller towns. It is here
and there besprinkled with beautiful gardens, in
which are cultivated, besides the date-palm, several
of the choicest fruits that grow on the coast&mdash;as figs,
grapes, peaches, pomegranates, and melons. In
these gardens, as in most of the oases of the desert,
the fruit trees that require most protection from the
sun are planted between the palms, which make a
kind of roof with their long leaves. Abd-el-Galeel
destroyed many of these groves to punish their
owners, refractory to his authority.</p>

<p>Two crops are obtained in the year: in the
spring, barley and wheat are reaped; and in the
summer and autumn, Indian corn, ghaseb, and other
kinds of grain. All the culture is carried on by
means of irrigation, the water being thrown over the
fields by means of runnels of various dimensions
twice in the day; that is, once early in the morning,
and once late in the afternoon until dark.</p>

<p>Wady Ghudwah is a single town with gardens,
and the other features common to all the Fezzan
oases.</p>

<p>Sebha includes two towns, having a considerable
population, with gardens and date-palms.</p>

<p>Bouanees includes three towns, well peopled,
and has immense numbers of date-palms.</p>

<p>El-Jofrah contains the second capital or large
town of the pashalic, Sockna, built of stones and<a name="page84" id="page84"></a><span class="pageno">[84]</span>
mud, with nine or ten smaller towns, all tolerably
populous.</p>

<p>Sockna is situated midway between Mourzuk
and Tripoli, and is about fourteen days from the
former. The inhabitants are Moors, and, besides
Arabic, speak a Berber dialect. Sockna is celebrated
for its fine sweet dates, called kothraee; and
there is abundance of every kind of this fruit.
A considerable quantity of grain is sown&mdash;wheat
and barley&mdash;and the gardens abound with peaches.
The town of Honn, distant about two hours from
this place, is nearly as large, and also surrounded
with gardens.</p>

<p>Wady Gharby, and Es-Shaty, have already
been described. In the sands between these two
places are situated the celebrated natron lakes, in
which that miraculous dud ("worm") spontaneously
appears at certain seasons of the year, and is eaten
as people in Europe eat sardines&mdash;to sharpen the
appetite. The natron is also a source of profitable
exportation. Wady Sharky almost exactly resembles
Wady Gharby, in population and natural
features.</p>

<p>Sharkeeah, besides some insignificant places,
includes the interesting ancient capital called
Zoueelah, whence the name of Zoilah is given by the
Tibboos to all Fezzan. Half the population of this
place consists of Shereefs, and there are indeed great
and increasing numbers of this class of persons
throughout the whole country.<a name="page85" id="page85"></a><span class="pageno">[85]</span></p>

<p>Ghatroun includes, with Tajerby the most southern
place of Fezzan, three small towns. The inhabitants
are all black, speaking the Tibbooese and
Bornouese languages, and very little Arabic. The
other nine districts above enumerated contain a
mixed race, like the population of Mourzuk; but
some of the northern towns are inhabited by people
of purer blood, with comparatively fair complexions.</p>

<p>Mourzuk itself, the seat of the Pashalic,&mdash;distant
about four hundred and twenty miles from Tripoli,
in a straight line, and five hundred, counting the
sinuosities of the road, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Benioleed, Bonjem, and
Sockna,&mdash;is a rising town, becoming daily more
salubrious by the improvements made since the
residence of the Turks here, and the subjection of
the inhabitants to a more orderly and powerful
government than they had been accustomed to.
The British Consul, Mr. Gagliuffi, has rendered important
aid to the administration, in embellishing
the appearance of Mourzuk, and giving it the air
and character of a Turkish city of the coast. Our
camel-drivers pretend that it is already superior to
Tripoli. At the Consul's suggestion a colonnade has
been built in the main street, in front of the shops,
affording shelter from the fiery rays of the summer
sun, as well as being an agreeable place for the natives
to lounge under and make their purchases. He was
also the principal promoter of the erection of new barracks
for the troops, and the appropriation of a large
house as a hospital for the poor. His last improvement<a name="page86" id="page86"></a><span class="pageno">[86]</span>
is the plantation of a garden of the choice fruit-trees
and vegetables of the coast; and his example
has been imitated by the Bim Bashaw, commandant
of the troops, who is now laying out a garden in a
conspicuous part of the city.</p>

<p>Since the departure of Abd-el-Galeel with his
Arab followers, the Walad Suleiman, for the neighbourhood
of Bornou, the province of Fezzan has
certainly enjoyed profound tranquillity. But on
account of heavy taxation, high customs' dues,
and other clogs to free commerce, the people are
sinking deeper and deeper into poverty and wretchedness,
and, except in the capital, there is a general
retrograde movement. The Ottoman yoke is a
peculiarly heavy one; it keeps the people in order,
but it crushes them; and perhaps the Fezzanees
may now regret somewhat the wholesome anarchy
that distinguished the Arab chieftain's reign.</p>

<p>As I have said, the entire population of the
ten districts of Fezzan is, according to the last
Turkish census, only about twenty-six thousand souls,
of whom about eleven thousand are males, including
the children. The disproportion of the sexes arises
in part from the number of female slaves, in part
from the emigration of the men to the commercial
countries of the interior, either for temporary
gain, or permanently to escape from the grinding
weight of taxation.</p>

<p>The whole amount of revenue collected by the
Government is estimated at fifty thousand mahboubs
per annum. Twenty-three thousand of<a name="page87" id="page87"></a><span class="pageno">[87]</span>
these are raised by direct taxation, whilst the
remainder is produced by customs' dues and
the date-palm groves, which are the property of
Government.</p>

<p>The military force by which the Turks hold possession
of this vast but thinly-peopled territory&mdash;stretching
north and south twenty-one days' journey, or
about three hundred miles&mdash;is the very inconsiderable
number of six hundred and thirty men. The garrison
of Mourzuk itself consists of four hundred and thirty
men, of whom about one-half are Fezzanees, twenty
or thirty Turks, and the residue Arabs or Moors.
The remaining three hundred are Arab cavaliers,
living chiefly on their own means, and changed
every year, who serve as a flying corps, or mounted
police, for all the districts of Fezzan. The rate of
pay for this latter class is one kail of wheat and half
a mahboub per month for those who have no horses,
and one kail of dates additional for those who are
mounted. This division, however, is fastidious at
present, as all those on service in Fezzan are now
possessed of horses. In the whole regency of Tripoli
there are but six hundred and sixty of these Arab
soldiers; but in Bonjem and the Syrtis they are not
cavalry, and the detachment at Ghadamez is
mixed.<a name="anchor3" id="anchor3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I am afraid these janissaries are obliged to<a name="page88" id="page88"></a><span class="pageno">[88]</span>
commit spoliations in the towns and districts where
they are stationed to avoid starvation.</p>

<p>I visited the barracks of Mourzuk, and found them
to be commodious, and apparently salubrious. The
good living of these stationary troops surprised me.
They have meat and excellent soup everyday, with
rice and biscuit. The Fezzanee is never so well fed
and well clothed and lodged as when he is a soldier.
Indeed the men seem too well off, in comparison with
their former state and with the rest of the population.
Nevertheless, they are glad to escape when
the time of their service expires. The people all
dread being made soldiers: so that Government is
compelled to resort to the most paltry tricks to get
recruits. Men are often unjustly charged with
theft or debt, and put in prison, and then let out as a
favour to be enlisted, or sometimes are clapped into
the ranks at once. Youths have been seized as soldiers
for kicking up the dust in front of a sentinel
and dirtying his clothes. I remarked the number of
soldiers that were black, and the Bim Bashaw
observed that he hoped the time would come when
there would not be a white private left in Mourzuk.
The Turks manage to do with twenty or thirty of
their own people, mostly officers, in this garrison;
but, by one method or another, get as many
Fezzanee recruits as they want.</p>

<p>The Turkish system is vastly superior to the
French in this important matter of garrisoning their
possessions in Northern Africa. The latter require
one hundred men where the Turks are content with<a name="page89" id="page89"></a><span class="pageno">[89]</span>
one to hold the country. Perhaps one of the chief
reasons may be the difference of religion. The
Arabs and other natives of North Africa cannot
endure the sight of a ruler of another faith. Something,
however, may be attributed to the immense
and sacred authority of the Ottoman Sultan, the
great chief of the Mussulmans of the East, as the
Shereefan Emperor of Morocco is the chief of the
Mussulmans of the West. We may add, also, the
tremendous severity of the Turkish criminal law, or,
rather, the inexorable justice with which a crime
committed against a Turkish functionary is visited.
The French make their razzias and strike off heads
enough; but their criminal code in Algeria is perhaps
not so summary and sanguinary as that of the Turks.
Possibly one of the chief reasons of this curious
contrast may be the fact that the French soldier is
scarcely to be depended on when isolated. He acts
well in masses, but considers himself deserted and
betrayed when left comparatively alone. At any
rate, the fact is that the Turks hold Tripoli with a
handful of men, whilst the French, with a military
force nearly as large as the whole British army,
can scarcely maintain a feverish and uncertain possession
of Algeria.</p>

<p>The population of Mourzuk numbers two thousand
souls. It is very much mixed, and the people
vary greatly in colour, so that there is no general
character. There are more women than children,
the greater portion of the females belonging to the<a name="page90" id="page90"></a><span class="pageno">[90]</span>
members of the great winter caravans. Contrary
to what I had been told, these women seem to be
rather remarkable for modesty and virtue than
otherwise. It is worth observing, that Fatamah, the
proper name of Mahomet's daughter, is here used, by
excess of delicacy, to describe the softer sex, more
especially ladies.</p>

<p>From October to January, as at Gh&acirc;t, there is a
large annual souk, or market, at Mourzuk. One
general caravan comes from Bornou and Soudan,
every year during the winter season, and small
bodies of merchants also go up and down to Soudan
in the summer; whilst to Bornou there is no intermediate
trade. Caravans also congregate here from
Egypt, Bengazi, Tripoli, Ghadamez, Gh&acirc;t, and
Tuat. From forty thousand to sixty thousand Spanish
dollars is the value of the merchandise that usually
changes hands during the great mart. The principal
articles of traffic from the interior are slaves,
senna, and ivory. This is the first year that a
hundred and fifty cantars of elephants' teeth have
been brought from Bornou; sixty or seventy of
these were consigned to one merchant, forty were on
account of the Vizier of Bornou, and the remainder
belonged to Arab traders. This export of elephants'
teeth direct <i>vi&acirc;</i> Fezzan has only lately been opened.
Some manufactured cottons are likewise brought
from Soudan, and sell easily in this part of the Sahara,
especially amongst the Tuaricks. Besides, there
are exported bullocks' and goats' skins, and a small<a name="page91" id="page91"></a><span class="pageno">[91]</span>
quantity of ostrich feathers. The gum trade has
lately been introduced into Fezzan by the British
Consul, and one hundred cantars per annum are
already collected from the tholukh-trees.</p>

<p>The acting Governor of Fezzan always resides
at Mourzuk. His principal coadjutors in the despatch
of affairs are a Kady with two secretaries, a
Sheikh or mayor of the city, some respectable men
who act as privy councillors, the Wakeels of Bengazi,
Augila, Sokna, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A little story may find its place here, as an apt
illustration of the state of society and manners in
this out-of-the-way capital. A married woman
preferred another man to her husband, and frankly
confessed that her affections had strayed. Her lord,
instead of flying into a passion, and killing her on
the spot, thought a moment, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will consent to divorce you, if you will
promise one thing."</p>

<p>"What is that?" inquired the delighted wife.</p>

<p>"You must looloo to me only when I pass on
the day of the celebration of your nuptials with the
other man."</p>

<p>Now it is, the custom for women, under such
circumstances, to looloo (that is, salute with a peculiar
cry) any handsome male passer-by. However,
the woman promised, the divorce took place, and
the lover was soon promoted into a second husband.
On the day of the wedding, however, the man who
had exacted the promise passed by the camel on<a name="page92" id="page92"></a><span class="pageno">[92]</span>
which the bride was riding, and saluted her, as is
the custom, with the discharge of his firelock.
Upon this she remembered, and looloed to him.
The new bridegroom, enraged at this marked preference,
noticing that she had not greeted any one
else, and thinking possibly that he was playing the
part of a dupe, instantly fell upon his bride and slew
her. He had scarcely done so when the brothers of
the woman came up and shot him down; so that the
first husband compassed ample vengeance without
endangering himself in the slightest degree. This
is an instance of Arab cunning.</p>

<p>A subject of considerable importance was brought
under my attention at Mourzuk. It appears that
whilst the objects of legitimate commerce, in being
exported from the interior to Fezzan and Tripoli,
pay double duties&mdash;that is, twelve and a-half per
cent in each place&mdash;slaves pay no transit duty
whatever in this regency of Barbary if they are
destined for the Constantinople market, and even if
sold in Tripoli or Fezzan only pay once a duty of
ten mahboubs per head. It frequently happens
besides that the Turkish merchants, who embark
with their slaves for Constantinople, sell a considerable
number on the way. On arriving at their
destination, they pretend that such as are missing
from their register have died; and in this manner
they contrive to evade the payment of all duty
whatever. It has been attempted to get the impost
of ten mahboubs paid in Mourzuk, and likewise to<a name="page93" id="page93"></a><span class="pageno">[93]</span>
force all the caravans to take that route. This would
have acted as a check upon the slave-trade; but the
influence of the Gadamsee merchants was too great
to allow the measure to be carried out. It is most
important that the legitimate trade should not be
burdened with double custom-dues, and it is to be
hoped that the influence of the British Government
will be used to bring about some reform in
this matter. We should bear in mind, that as most
of the goods and merchandise passing through Fezzan
are only in transit, they are therefore legally subject
to a duty of no more than three per cent.</p>

<p>I have paid as much attention to this subject of
the encouragement of the legitimate trade as my
time and other occupations would allow me. It will
be as well to make a note here on another point,
though it may seem out of place,&mdash;the existence of
sulphur in the Syrtis. There appears no doubt that this
substance can be procured at the foot of a mountain
called Gebel Sinoube, about six miles from the sea
at the innermost point of the Syrtis. A considerable
quantity is obtained by the Arabs near this mountain,
about eighteen camel-hours south-west from a
place on the coast called Maktar, the eastern limits
of the district Syrt. There is also good sulphur
found in the Gebel-Harouj, five or six days east
from Sokna. But what is really the per-centage
of pure sulphur on the rough masses of the mines is
not ascertained; nor is the quality precisely known,
except that of the Harouj mountain. Accurate information<a name="page94" id="page94"></a><span class="pageno">[94]</span>
could only be procured by despatching a
trustworthy Sicilian miner to make a report.
Perhaps these mines could only be brought into
profitable working in the event of the stoppage of a
supply from Sicily. It has been proposed to establish
a colony of Maltese at Zafran, on the shore of
the Syrtis. If this idea were carried out, the sulphur
mines might by this means be brought into play.</p>

</div>

<p><i>May 7th.</i>&mdash;We are already busy with preparations
for our start to the interior. Mr. Gagliuffi has
written to Gh&acirc;t to-day for Hateetah and his escort
of Tuaricks. Excitement protects us, perhaps,
from the deadly influence of the climate of Mourzuk.
Mr. Gagliuffi is recovering from a severe
attack, and anticipates being obliged to leave for
the coast. We trust he will not be driven from his
post whilst we are in Soudan. However, we must<a name="page96" id="page96"></a><span class="pageno">[96]</span>
trust to the same Providence that has hitherto
watched over us.</p>

<p>I am having all our letters of recommendation
for the interior copied, to be sent home to Government,
so that if anything happen to us they may
know what kind of support we have received. If
anything happen! The presence of that doubt gives
a solemnity and an importance to the most trifling
thing we do. A soldier is allowed to indulge in
serious thought before going into battle, and the
chances in his favour are greater than those in
ours. We, too, may have to do battle with men;
but the dangers of the desert are also arrayed
against us, and when they are passed, the miasmas
of Central Africa fill the air beyond.</p>

<p>The marabout, with his camel and burden, has
not yet come up; he left us to visit his country.
We are likewise still without news of three camel-loads
left behind at Mizdah. There is always a
train of stragglers behind every caravan that is not
huddled together by fear. We should never have
procured beasts enough on the road, and did well
to take them direct from Tripoli. The Pasha's
circular letter was of little or no use in this respect;
and, indeed, we could not expect it to cause camels
to start out of the ground.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;I paid a visit to the commandant of the
troops, Runthar Aga, Bim Bashaw, quite a Christian
Moor; and got information on military affairs
whilst tasting the soup in the kitchen. Also called<a name="page97" id="page97"></a><span class="pageno">[97]</span>
upon our old friend the Doctor, and inspected the
hospital, which certainly holds out no temptation to
a man to be ill. The patients are few: two have
strong fevers; five or six are convalescent; the sick-list
contains no other cases; but it will be different
when summer comes on.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;Received a visit from the acting Governor,
and presented him with a bottle of snuff. Like
other great men, this Pasha makes a great consumption
of rappee, and empties nearly a box
a-day.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;The military seem to have taken a fancy
to us. Here comes the Commandant, to return our
call, with all the officers of the garrison. Smiles
and courtesy are the order of the day. Dr. Overweg
brings out some of his scientific instruments,
and the knowing ones have an opportunity of
showing their ignorance. All passes off well. Mr.
Gagliuffi observes: "You would not have had
so much attention paid to you in Tripoli." Possibly;
but this may partly be accounted for by the
rarity of Europeans at Mourzuk. Familiarity has
not had time to breed contempt.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;There is excitement in the town. What
news? The new acting Governor, my old acquaintance
of Ghadamez, Rais Mustapha, is in sight,
hull above the horizon. We all go out to meet
him, and soon see his <i>cort&egrave;ge</i> breaking between
the groves. This is the gayest and most spirited
scene I have witnessed since leaving Tripoli. Mustapha<a name="page98" id="page98"></a><span class="pageno">[98]</span>
brings his staff and 200 Arab cavaliers with
him, to relieve the Fezzan irregulars. They make
a gallant-looking body of men as they come swiftly
on. All the authorities of the town, with whatever
cavalry is already collected here, pour out of the
gates to pay their compliments; and then come
crowds of the lower classes of citizens, with their
rude bagpipes, which scream discordantly. The
horsemen galloped hither and thither in the plain
whilst the interview between the great men took
place, and effectually drowned all the polite things
that were said by their trampling and hurrahing.
We rode up likewise to welcome the new great
man. Mustapha looked well, was excellently
mounted, and dressed almost like an European officer.
He smiled graciously on seeing his old
friend of Ghadamez, and shook me by the hand;
he also recognised the Germans, having seen them
at Zaweeah, near Tripoli. Satisfied with this little
interview, we drew aside, and the procession moved
towards the gate. There was instantly a rush of the
Arab horsemen, every one trying to get in front;
and as the entry was narrow an obstruction soon
took place. We drew aside, and called out to
those who were pressing on to make way for the
Governor. One fellow would not hear; and Mustapha
himself riding up, lashed him with a small
whip across the shoulders. Bad taste; but perhaps
excusable in this case, if ever. These lawless
soldiery can never be taught good manners, without<a name="page99" id="page99"></a><span class="pageno">[99]</span>
which true discipline is impossible. However,
we at length got within the gate, and the procession
poured along the streets, the women <i>loo-looing</i> as
we passed, the bagpipes shrieking louder than ever,
the crowd buzzing, the horses thundering, the cavaliers
shouting. In fine, this hubbub carried us
quite back into the regions of civilisation, where
men collect on public occasions often without any
real joy, and by mere process of action and reaction
succeed in working themselves up into a state of
boisterous enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Several days were now chiefly occupied in writing
reports on the progress made by the expedition
hitherto; and in voluminous correspondence on
petty, matters&mdash;petty, I mean, in themselves, but
very important to us&mdash;all connected with our future
proceedings. I forwarded to the Foreign Office a
letter addressed by the Sultan Laoul, of the Tibboos
of Bilma, to Mr. Gagliuffi. It appears these
people are now nominally subject to the Ottoman
Porte.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;We went to pay a visit to Mustapha
Agha, my old friend of Ghadamez. He received
us with all the honours&mdash;a guard of officers, pipes,
coffee, and sherbet. That important subject of
health was a good deal talked of. Mustapha fears
the climate of Fezzan, and finds little consolation
in the doctrines of fatalism. He seemed surprised
at the bulk of the despatches last forwarded from the
Consulate, and asked if we all knew how to write.
He cannot understand the necessity of minute<a name="page100" id="page100"></a><span class="pageno">[100]</span>
directions. We explained as well as we could; and
then talked of the journeys we had respectively performed.
This gave Mustapha an opportunity of
astonishing us in his Turkish way. He said that he
had come with 200 men and 300 camels from
Tripoli in sixteen days, having stopped only one
day, and travelled regularly from three in the
afternoon to nine next morning. We marvelled,
as in duty bound; but refrained not from making
inquiries; the result of which was, that the real time
was thirty-one days, only eight days less than we
had occupied. We did not scold Mustapha for his
exaggeration, but might perhaps have done so
without offence. When a Turk does tell a lie, he
submits to be accused of it with good-humour.</p>

<p>After leaving the hyperbolical Governor, we
went to see Sheikh Mohammed Boro, Sakontaroua
of Aghadez, who has arrived here <i>en route</i>
from Mekka. He was recommended to us by
Hassan Pasha of Tripoli; but Mr. Gagliuffi does
not think much of him. We shall see.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;Walked in the gardens, and were pleased
with their aspect. On returning, I wrote out the
different kinds of dates in this country. We saw
some Egyptian camels with a pilgrim caravan, of
a dark and almost black colour.</p>

<p>My Fezzanee marabout, by the way, has left
Mourzuk, after making me a present of some cakes
and dates of dainty quality. He has been of great
use to me, and I shall remember him with pleasure.</p>

<p>I had to-day a conversation with a Tibboo of<a name="page101" id="page101"></a><span class="pageno">[101]</span>
Tibesty. How interesting it is to talk with the
natives of those untrodden countries, to which
chance may some day lead us! He says Tibesty
is ten days from Gatroun, and fourteen from Mourzuk.
It is all mountainous, except one long wady
where the population is located. There is no regular
town; but all along the valley the population,
which is said to be about 5000, though desert
statistics are little to be credited, is scattered in
groups of three or four, cultivating the ground and
tending on the flocks which feed on the rich
herbage, whilst goats scramble for food along the
slopes of the boundary mountains. The people
dwell either in huts or in caverns scooped out of
the sides of hills, some of them very extensive.
What a picture of primitive life! Families living
separate, not yet driven to hide behind walls, or
congregate in masses for safety. The desert is their
bulwark. This place lies, indeed, far east of the
caravan route from Bornou. There is no road
direct eastward from Tibesty, but caravans can go
south-east to Wada&iuml;. The valley produces, besides
other grain, a good quantity of ghaseb, which is the
principal food of the inhabitants. Some palms rise
here and there in clumps, but are not very productive;
and dates are imported from Fezzan.
The tree most frequent is the tholukh; but there
is also another common tree, called the arak. In
the open country, the wadan, the gazelle, and the
ostrich are found, and the people hunt them with
dogs. Good water is supplied by wells and streams,<a name="page102" id="page102"></a><span class="pageno">[102]</span>
in sufficient quantities to irrigate the fields of
ghaseb, wheat, and barley. Rain is abundant some
years, but fails in others; torrents are continually
descending from the mountains: one stream flows
through a space of two days' journey. If these accounts
be correct, the country must be one of the
most interesting in Africa. They say, that on account
the height of the mountains some of the inhabitants
do not see the moon for fifteen days together. A
Sultan rules paternally in this out-of-the-way country,
where the Mohammedan religion reigns paramount.
My informant made me pay three Tunisian
piastres and two common handkerchiefs for a
vocabulary of the language of the Tibboos of
Tibesty. A visit to this singular oasis might repay
a hardy traveller; but the people of the country
have a faithless character, and it would be
dangerous to trust to their promises of protection.</p>

<p>The Tibesty Tibboos must not be confounded
with the Tibboos of the salt-mines of Bilma, who
have recently made their submission to the Porte.
There is little connexion between the people, although
they speak a similar language. The Bilma
Tibboos lie in the direct route to Bornou, and were
fully studied by the Denham and Clapperton
expedition.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;Continue to prepare papers to send
home. Report the fact, that the functionaries of
Mourzuk trade in slaves.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;I had lent Mustapha a sword; but, after
keeping it a night, he was obliged to return it, sending<a name="page103" id="page103"></a><span class="pageno">[103]</span>
word that a firm&acirc;n had been written to all the
functionaries of the Porte, forbidding them to receive
any presents,&mdash;an excellent measure, doing credit to
the Sultan's administration. The great plague of
the East is the system of bribery carried on
under the form of presents. The pay of the Pasha
is six hundred and fifty mahboubs per month, nearly
all spent in the town.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;The weather is extremely hot and sultry.
The sun burns the umbrella if you pass for a few
minutes under it. Even the natives complain of the
extreme heat of the weather.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;Not quite so oppressive; but, as Dr.
Barth says, the south wind blows throughout Northern
Africa in May.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;This morning, the black who came with
us, and had two wives, divorced one of them, returning
the woman's dowry of thirty-seven Tunisian
piastres. The divorce took place before the Kady
in the open streets.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;Haj Lameen came to see me. He
does not forget to remind us that the Tuaricks
expect many presents. I have no doubt they do.
He says we must be generous at all the following
places:&mdash;Gh&acirc;t, Aheer, Aghadez, Damerghou,
Zinder, Minyou, Tesaouah, Kashna, Kanou, Sakkatou,
Bornou, Begharmi, Mandara, and to the
Tibboos of Bilma; not to mention the intermediate
towns and villages. However, if the presents be
valuable, we may expect in some places rations of<a name="page104" id="page104"></a><span class="pageno">[104]</span>
food in return. It is worthy of remark, that this
said Haj Lameen, brother of the governor of Gh&acirc;t,
took an oath during the past year that he would
never again purchase slaves. This is a remarkable
instance of the progress of opinion. I afterwards
gave Lameen a present, consisting of one pound of
tea, five pounds of coffee, and four heads of loaf
sugar. This was the first considerable present I
made. In the evening we observed Mercury in
conjunction with Venus. The heavens were unusually
bright for Mourzuk. We saw also
Jupiter's satellites at seven in the evening. The two
upper ones were much nearer than the two lower
ones to the great planet, but all in a line. Mars
was very bright. The rings, or extinct volcanoes of
the moon, were also truly transparent this evening.
Usually the sky of Mourzuk is charged with a dirty
red haze, and not at all favourable to astronomical
observations.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;The culture of water-melons is progressing
for the summer season. The melons are planted in
the irrigation ducts that lead to the squares of
clover, which is cultivated at this season for the
horses of the cavalry stationed here, and also for the
camels of the merchants. Every fifteen or twenty
days a fresh crop is ready, all produced by irrigation.</p>

<p>The fig-tree is found frequently in the gardens
of Fezzan, and when planted near a well, produces
as fine fruit as those on the coast. The rich green<a name="page105" id="page105"></a><span class="pageno">[105]</span>
of its leaves is very refreshing to the eye. During
the present season, however, the greater portion of
the gardens is devoted to onion-raising. Whole
fields are covered with this vegetable. Parsley is
running to seed. The korna is also seen in the
suburbs. Few birds visit the gardens of Fezzan,
which are all planted with palms. One or two
groves have been recently added, and are distinguished
as the "new trees." The irrigated beds
are covered with palm-shoots, the curving fan-like
leaves bending prettily over the ground.</p>

<p>The winnowing of grain is conducted in the most
slovenly manner. The ripe ears with the dry stalks
are thrown on the sand, and then half-a-dozen
donkeys are driven over them&mdash;an animated threshing
machine. The grain, of course, mixes with the
sand, and is separated from it with considerable loss
and waste of time.</p>

<p>The sandy soil of the gardens is sometimes
mixed with a large quantity of salt, which gives
it a firm consistence. Of this soil the houses of
the city are built. Rain would melt them; but
this blessing never cools the scorching atmosphere
of Mourzuk.<a name="anchor4" id="anchor4"></a><a href="#footnote4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In this day's agricultural and horticultural walk
I fell in with the nymphs of the gardens; or, in
other words, the washerwomen of Mourzuk. They<a name="page106" id="page106"></a><span class="pageno">[106]</span>
come out constantly to the wells, when the irrigation
is going on, early in the morning or late in the
evening, and thus take advantage of the supply of
water raised. They are all dark women of the city,
for the most part unlovely and very dirty in appearance,
despite their occupation. Their system of
washing is the primitive one practised by the
labouring classes all over the north of Africa. They
roll up the clothes into a round flat heap, and then
with their heels keep up a continual round of treading,
using for soap a peculiar sort of clay. Some of
the girls are very impudent and immodest when a
stranger passes by; but as a rule they are not so.
The wells at Mourzuk are not all good; some are
fresh, others salt. In many places will be found a
well of very sweet, delicious water; and running
nearly to the surface, at twenty paces distant from it,
are found others really quite salt. The same phenomenon
has been observed at Siwah, in the Libyan
desert.</p>

<p>One of our party received a present this morning
of some fresh and most delicious leghma. A good
deal is drunk in Mourzuk, in an acrid state, for the
purposes of intoxication.</p>

<p>In the evening I went to see the acting Pasha,
with the Consul. He received us with his usual
urbanity, and gave coffee and lemonade twice. He
mentioned the things which a functionary of government
was permitted to receive as presents,&mdash;viz., two
sheep, twelve pounds and a half of butter, fifty eggs,
and two fowls. This to be received once only from<a name="page107" id="page107"></a><span class="pageno">[107]</span>
a friend. But some of the functionaries say they
can receive a cantar of butter, if divided into sufficiently
small quantities, and spread over several
days.</p>

<p>People all admire the clock I purchased for the
Sultan of Sakkatou, to give him instead of the
chronometer. When it strikes the hours, I tell them
it speaks various languages, at which they are
greatly astonished.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening, a shower of bats made their
appearance at dusk.</p>

<p><i>22d.</i>&mdash;I went with Dr. Overweg to visit the Pilgrims.
We had previously examined the head of
one of them phrenologically. The news had been
spread in the tents, and the whole troop came to
have their craniums studied on our arrival amongst
them. This science&mdash;if such it can be called&mdash;tickles
the fancies of people hereabouts, being suited
to their capacity. One fellow wished to know from
his head whether he should gain much money this
year. They looked upon the matter as a species of
fortune-telling.</p>

<p><i>23d.</i>&mdash;The Pilgrims' heads must have itched all
night. Here they are again to have them handled!
All the polls in Mourzuk will probably pass under
our hands if this goes on. It is singular that the
pilgrimage to Mekka has not nourished sufficient
fanaticism to prevent these good people from allowing
an infidel doctor to make free with their crowns,
and expatiate on their passions and propensities.<a name="page108" id="page108"></a><span class="pageno">[108]</span>
There is no calculating on the strength of the
impulse of curiosity.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;The Queen's birthday. At eight o'clock
Mr. Gagliuffi fired a musket, and hoisted the
British jack and pennant over the Consulate. At
noon, fifty-one discharges of muskets and matchlocks
announced the auspicious event to the natives of
this city, and to the Tibboos, Tuaricks, Soudanese,
Bornouese, and all other strangers of the Sahara and
Central Africa. In the evening, the Consul gave a
dinner to us travellers and to the Pasha and his
officers. The healths of her Majesty, the Sultan,
and the King of Prussia, were drunk in champagne
with enthusiasm. There were thirty or forty dishes
on the table, and among them a turkey, the first
ever killed in this city. Mr. Gagliuffi had recently
brought a cock and hen from Tripoli. A small
saloon was decorated with banners and cotton-stuffs
of Soudan, with various devices. Amongst these were
a small portrait of her Majesty; an Ottoman blood-red
flag, with its crescent and star; and a white flag
with the Prussian black eagle. The effect was excellent,
and quite astonished the natives. The Turks
ate and drank famously, and for the most part got
"elevated." When in this state it was curious to
see them clawing at the viands, utterly forgetful of
Eastern gravity and decorum. I must observe, however,
that Mustapha Bey himself and one other
officer declined to drink wine. The Turks seem very
tolerant to one another in this respect. It is left as<a name="page109" id="page109"></a><span class="pageno">[109]</span>
a matter for the decision of every man's individual
conscience. These sensible people do not think that,
because a man is inclined to be an ascetic himself,
he is bound to force all other people to be so likewise.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;I took a walk in the gardens this evening,
and came upon two or three small circular orchards,
having within the circle simply room for holding
water, like a shallow pond, with fruit-trees, vines, fig-trees,
and pomegranates clustering around. These
orchards, when thus formed close by the well-side,
are very luxuriant. People now begin to sow ghaseb,
ghafouly, dra, and such grains, which are reaped
in the summer season. Barley and wheat are sown
in autumn or winter, and reaped in spring. As I
walked I noticed that the sky was darkly overcast,
as if threatening rain; and presently, sure enough, a
few precious drops fell on the thirsty sandy soil!</p>

<p>I observed a new plant, large, with broad and
smooth thick velvety leaves, but omitted to write
down the name. It produces a milky juice, with
which the people dye the palms of their hands, instead
of with henna. The plant has a disagreeable odour,
and every appearance of being poisonous; but they
say it is not so, being only bitter in taste.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;In my morning's walk I had the coolest
weather experienced since our arrival at Mourzuk.
The wind was from the north-east and the sky much
overcast. It actually rained,&mdash;a slight shower of
ten minutes' duration. How gratefully the trees<a name="page110" id="page110"></a><span class="pageno">[110]</span>
seemed to spread their leaves to catch the pleasing
drops! The gardens and groves all wore a happy
smile. We hear, that lately a great deal of rain has
fallen in the Gh&acirc;t district, and on the route to
Aheer.</p>

<p>The people are preparing to thresh their corn,
and I was interested in observing all the details of
their process. They had scattered yesterday evening
the full ripe grain in its dry stalks over the ground,
in the form of a large circle, to the depth of about
two inches; and had then smoothed the sand all
around in small ridges, so that if a thief came
during the night they might observe his footmarks.
They thresh out the grain by means of four or five
asses or camels tied abreast, and driven round and
round over this primitive floor. Great waste is
occasioned by allowing the grain to mix with and
sink in the sand; the task of winnowing is most
difficult afterwards.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;This day I had some conversation with
Boro, the Sheikh of Aghadez, about the country
and localities of Aheer,&mdash;a Saharan kingdom never
yet explored, and which we intend to traverse on
our circuitous route across the desert. It appears
that Aheer is the general name of the whole cluster
of towns and districts; that Aghadez is the medineh,
or city; and that Asouty is a town on the line of
the caravan route to Soudan,&mdash;a regular halting-place.
Asben and Asbenouah are other names
given to this same territory, and do not denote<a name="page111" id="page111"></a><span class="pageno">[111]</span>
other countries. The Tibboos and Bornouese describe
the whole territory of Fezzan as Zoilah, a
name derived from that of the ancient capital,
Zoueelah. These double names have hitherto
caused great confusion in laying down unvisited
places in the desert. If we can penetrate and
explore the kingdom of Aheer or Asben, it will be
doing a great service to geography.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;I am studying rural life in the neighbourhood
of Mourzuk, as if it were to be my occupation.
Scarcely a day passes that I do not escape from the
crowded town and wander, either morning or
evening, into the gardens, the groves, and the fields.
The water raised by rude machinery from the wells
is always dancing along in little runnels. The
chattering of women crosses my path right and left.
Groups of labourers or gardeners occur frequently.
A man this day valued a date-palm at a mahboub,
and I am told that the greater number are not
worth more than a shilling of English money. To
avert the evil eye from the gardens, the people put
up the head of an ass, or some portion of the bones
of that animal. The same superstition prevails in
all the oases that stud the north of Africa, from
Egypt to the Atlantic, but the people are unwilling
to explain what especial virtue there exists in an
ass's skull. We go sometimes to shoot doves in
the gardens; but these birds are very shy, and after
the first shot fly from tree to tree and keep out of
range. So we stroll about making observations, to<a name="page112" id="page112"></a><span class="pageno">[112]</span>
console ourselves for the loss of sport. We noticed
several cotton-bushes, but this useful plant is not
cultivated here except that it may ornament the
gardens with its green. I have just eaten of the
heart of the date-tree. It is of a very delicious
bitter, and is a choice dish at feasts.</p>

<p>I met with a number of the suburban inhabitants
engaged in celebrating a wedding. First came a
group of women, dancing and throwing themselves
into a variety of slow, languid, and lascivious postures,
to the sound of some very primitive string-instrument.
Towards this group all the women of
the neighbouring huts were gathering, some merely
as spectators, others bringing dishes of meat.
Beyond was a crowd of men, among whom was
the bridegroom helping the musicians to make a
noise. These musicians were an old man and old
woman, each above ninety years of age. The latter
beat a calabash with a stick, whilst the former drew
a bow over a single string tied to another calabash.
The bridegroom had got hold of a brass kettle, with
which he supplied his contribution to the din.
Preparations for supper were going on; and, the
harmony announcing this fact, idlers were coming
in flocks from the distant hamlets and the fields.
Two new huts had been built, one for the bride and
the other for the bridegroom.</p>

<p>These marriages produce very few children,
which may partly arise from licentiousness, but
chiefly, no doubt, from misery. I afterwards saw<a name="page113" id="page113"></a><span class="pageno">[113]</span>
the burial of an old lady, which ceremony set the
whole town in motion. The women screamed in
crowds, and a great number of men went outside
the walls to see the body consigned to its last
resting-place. Yusuf pretends that the burial took
place two hours after decease, which is the ordinary
practice here, although thirty-two hours are said to
be the proper time.</p>

<p>To the 21st of May I was occupied in preparing
a short report on Fezzan, with statements of the
expedition and other necessary documents.</p>

<p>We have had a grand dinner at the house of
the Greek doctor Paniotti. The Bey, Bim Bashaw,
his adjutant, the treasurer, and others were invited.
The French have boasted of the number of their
dishes, but I think the Turks beat them hollow in
this particular. Besides two whole lambs, fowls,
pigeons, there were at least twenty made dishes,
with every variety of rich sweetmeat. Amongst
the early fruits of the season we had figs and
apples. The dinner was not quite so merry as
Gagliuffi's, the champagne being absent.</p>

<p>We had a smart rain-shower in the morning,
and in the evening also there was a tempest of
wind and lightning, and a little rain. The flashes
were very vivid, and lighted up the whole firmament.</p>

<p>The Tibboos persist in saying that there is plenty
of water in their country, abundance of rain, frequent
springs; and some go so far as to describe<a name="page114" id="page114"></a><span class="pageno">[114]</span>
their streams as running a distance of from one to
eight days' journey. They acknowledge, however,
that the soil of their country is not very favourable
to much cultivation of grain and fruit. Perhaps
they want to attract visitors, but are not likely to
succeed at present. Justly or unjustly, they bear a
very bad character; and in Mourzuk, to call a man
a Tibboo is rather worse than to call a man a Jew
in Europe.</p>

<p><i>June 1st</i>, Post-day.&mdash;Letters, private and public,
were forwarded. It is now determined that we
shall start for Gh&acirc;t next Wednesday; at any rate the
Germans talk of doing so, whilst I am inclined to
wait for Hateetah and his escort. It would be imprudent
to run the risk of a disaster at this early
stage of our proceedings, and my greater responsibility
renders me more cautious, and perhaps more
timid, than my enthusiastic companions. I am
engaged in finishing my last despatches and
reports, collecting Arabic descriptions of Fezzan,
one of which is by the Bash Kateb, and corresponding
on the future expenditure of the Mission. The
weather has become very hot with the advancing
season, but I am now pretty well used to the heat.
The thermometer has risen to 103&deg;; in Bornou it
rarely exceeds 105&deg;: I may hope, therefore, to
brave the sun's rays under or near the line.</p>

<p>Few incidents worth recording mark the latter
days of our stay at Mourzuk. I paid a visit to Abd-el-Kader,
the Sheikh of the Pilgrims. This holy<a name="page115" id="page115"></a><span class="pageno">[115]</span>
person is quite humanized, and talks freely of the
politics of the Barbary coast. He entertained
myself, the German, the Greek doctor, and
Gagliuffi with tea; and this at <i>sunset</i>, when all the
other pilgrims were at their prayers. He is a
Tuatee of Gharai, and has been many times to
Mekka in his present capacity. Indeed he makes
the journey about once every three years. The
pilgrim caravans travel very fast; no others can
keep up with them. On leaving any place where
they have halted, the Sheikh has the privilege of
demanding the release of two or three prisoners;
and the scandalous whisper that any Barabbas can
sometimes obtain his liberty by a judicious investment
of presents. When encamped near a town,
moreover, the tent of the Sheikh becomes an inviolable
asylum for every criminal who chooses to
take refuge there. Many other privileges equally
valuable are enjoyed by this functionary. Abd-el-Kader
himself is an extremely urbane gentleman,
and we retired quite satisfied with our reception.
He gave me a vocabulary of the Tuatee dialect,
and some account of the statistics of the place,
which I forwarded to the Foreign Office. It
appears that formerly the people of Tuat paid to
the Algerines five hundred camel-loads of dates and
ten <i>necks</i> of gold, i.e. the gold ornaments sometimes
worn round the camels' necks. When the
French made their conquest, they sent to the Tuatees
to renew their tribute to them as the actual masters<a name="page116" id="page116"></a><span class="pageno">[116]</span>
of Algeria. The answer returned was, "Come and
take the tribute!"</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;The gardens continue to attract my
evening strolls. Every one is now busy sowing
ghaseb, and I passed a half hour in working with
some cheerful labourers at the preparation of the
ground, smoothing the soil in the squares for irrigation.
They were amused at my voluntary industry.
I sleep now late of mornings after my evening
exercise in the gardens, and find myself the better
for it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first melons ever eaten at Mourzuk
appeared on Mr. Gagliuffi's table about this time;
they were very good.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;The Germans were preparing to start
early in the morning; they are obliged to lighten
everything, and reduce each camel load to two and
a-half, or even two cantars. The Tuaricks will not
carry more; generally their maharees are small, and
they have few stray camels. The Germans went off
in good style and great spirits. They propose to
accompany a caravan of Tanelkum Tuaricks, who
go by way of Aroukeen, leaving Gh&acirc;t far on the
right. I was not able to persuade them to delay
their departure, so that we might all travel together:
but it may be expected that they will not find it so
very easy or safe to get through this country without
the special protection of those who claim authority
over it.</p>

<p>Two or three days of gheblee succeeded&mdash;unpleasant<a name="page117" id="page117"></a><span class="pageno">[117]</span>
weather to be out in the desert. I found it bad
enough at Mourzuk&mdash;100&deg; in the shade at four
o'clock in the afternoon. Hateetah was reported to
be on the road; so I determined to wait five or six
days for him, and thus not deviate from my original
plan.</p>

<p>I went to visit the wife of Mohammed Es-Sfaxee,
who goes with us to Soudan as a merchant,
carrying a considerable quantity of goods
on account of M. Gagliuffi: this gentleman accompanied
me. The object of our visit was to see
whether the Sfaxee had left a sufficient quantity of
provisions with his wife to support her during his
absence. It is necessary to take such precautions
with these Moors, who often barbarously abandon
their families, without any adequate provision, for
months and even for years together. We found that
he had left dates, wheat, and a little olive-oil and
mutton-fat&mdash;the ordinary stock of all families in
Fezzan. Only a few rich people indulge in such
luxuries as coffee, sugar, meat, and liquid butter.</p>

<p>An Arab saying: "You must always put other
people's things on your head, and your own under
your arm. Then, if there be danger of the things
falling off your head, you must raise your arm, and
let fall your own things to save those of others." I
do not know what things I shall let fall of my own;
but this I know, that during my whole residence in
Mourzuk my mind has been continually occupied in<a name="page118" id="page118"></a><span class="pageno">[118]</span>
endeavouring to save Government money. But I
have received little assistance.</p>

<p>The weather still continues hot, with wind from
the south: however, I walked in the gardens. On
the 16th, the boat went off to the caravan; the
camels carried it very easily, to the astonishment of
the good people of Mourzuk. On the 17th, the
thermometer was at 102&deg; in the shade&mdash;in the sun,
about 130&deg;. We received letters in answer to those
first written from Mourzuk, and learned that all the
despatches written on the road for Tripoli had arrived
in safety. The Arabs, therefore, are not quite so bad
as they are represented.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;At length Hateetah may be said to be reported
"in sight," and we are busy preparing for
departure. The escort has arrived at Tesaoua, and
will be here on Saturday at latest. As the Germans
are still at Tuggerter, we shall proceed on the Gh&acirc;t
route together, after all: it will be a tough piece of
work, whichever way performed. The heat continues
intense&mdash;from 100&deg; to 104&deg;, and 130&deg; in the sun.
Cooler weather is expected in August; but at present
all the natives complain, and fevers are becoming
prevalent. In the desert we shall escape
that danger; for disease comes only in the moist
depression of the plateau on which Mourzuk stands.
We hear talk, by the way, of a fine new route&mdash;only
forty days&mdash;just opened, from Gh&acirc;t to Timbuctoo,
across the deserts of Haghar. The present<a name="page119" id="page119"></a><span class="pageno">[119]</span>
Sultan of the Haghar Tuaricks is called
Ghamama.</p>

<p>One of our party, who undertook to accompany
us to take the management of the boat, has not
proved equal to the occasion; and I have therefore
written to Tripoli, to request that two Moorish
sailors, of Jerbah if possible, should be sent up by
the direct route to Bornou. I had almost engaged
a very excellent person at Tripoli, the captain of the
vessel in which I arrived; but when he called at the
Consulate on the subject, some minor official ordered
him off with a contemptuous "Barra! barra!" and
he accordingly yielded to the solicitations of his crew
and embarked without seeing me. There is too
much of this self-sufficiency and off-handedness in
all Consulates in the Levant, where a grain of authority
is apt at once to magnify a man, in his own
estimation, into a mighty potentate. I regret my
Jerbine captain very much; he originally volunteered
to accompany us, and entered into my plans with an
enthusiasm and intelligence rare among Muslims.</p>

<p>These small details of our expedition are interesting
to me to record, though probably many will
think them superfluous. Perhaps they will serve
to give a true idea of the magnitude of the undertaking,
and of the great responsibility which weighed
upon me, and thus prove an anticipatory excuse for
any accusation of shortcoming or dilatoriness that
may be preferred against me. I will not, however,
enter further into the business-details of the expedition&mdash;merely<a name="page120" id="page120"></a><span class="pageno">[120]</span>
observing that, among other things to
which I had to attend during my stay in Mourzuk,
were, in the first place, to collect provisions and
stores for a journey that may last two years;
secondly, to purchase presents for the princes and
other distinguished persons of the interior; and
thirdly, to provide against the casualties of the
journey, payment of salaries, &amp;c. All these things
I had to do on my own responsibility. Among other
things, I have purchased from Mr. Gagliuffi an Arab
gun and pair of pistols, inlaid with silver and curiously
wrought, for the sum of 180 mahboubs. This
is for a present to the Sheikh of Bornou, who will
expect something pleasing to the eye as well as the
boat, which he may at first, perhaps, not appreciate
at its full value.</p>

<p>I have already made a good many casual allusions
to our plans and arrangements; but it will be
necessary here, before our departure from the last
city that acknowledges the Ottoman authority, to
make a brief statement of our position and prospects.
Things that already appear clear to me may not
be so to others. During my former visit to Gh&acirc;t,
when I travelled as a private individual, known as
"Yak&#333;b," I made acquaintance with Hateetah, a
Tuarick Sheikh, who had assumed the title of
Consul of the English. It is the custom in that
country for every stranger on his arrival to put
himself under the protection of one of the head men,
to whom alone he makes presents, and who answers<a name="page121" id="page121"></a><span class="pageno">[121]</span>
for his safety. Mr. Gagliuffi had written to him to
come with an escort to protect our party as far as
Gh&acirc;t. It appears, however, that very grand accounts
had circulated in the Sahara on the magnitude
and importance of our mission; so that it was
impossible for one Sheikh to monopolise us. Hateetah,
therefore, had come, accompanied by two sons
of Shafou, the nominal Sultan of all the Tuaricks
of Gh&acirc;t. Wataitee, the elder of the two, is very
plausible, and undertakes to accompany us as far
as Aheer. It is to be observed, that the Tuaricks of
this place have hitherto never ventured to come to
Mourzuk; and it is considered wonderful that they
have come for the first time at the summons of
infidels.</p>

<p>My first plan was, to proceed by the direct route
to Aroukeen with the Germans and the Tanelkums,
and from this place make an indispensable expedition
to Gh&acirc;t. But circumstances compel me to
march direct to that place by the common road.
Our escort is to cost us dear, but it will ensure our
safety. These Gh&acirc;t Tuaricks, however great they
may talk in their own country, are really very poor;
they subsist almost entirely on the custom-dues levied
on caravans. Wataitee himself said, "I am the son
of the Sultan, it is true; but I have nothing. If
I stay in my country, I do not feel my necessities
much; but if I must escort you to Aheer, then I
must be well-clothed and fed, or else the people will
say, 'Behold the son of Shafou, how poor and<a name="page122" id="page122"></a><span class="pageno">[122]</span>
miserable he is!'" Besides paying about two hundred
Spanish dollars for the escort, I have had to
feed all the people, and furnish them with tents.
They had led me to expect much more reasonable
treatment; but there is no help, and I feel that I am
not yet at the end of my troubles of this description.
With these prefatory remarks, I enter upon an account
of my departure from Mourzuk for the oasis
of Gh&acirc;t.</p>

<p>Hateetah has brought stirring intelligence: the
Sultan of Bornou is at war with his brother. Ten
thousand Tuaricks of Aheer have gone against the
Walad Suleiman; and, taking advantage of the
opportunity, the Tuaricks of Timbuctoo are marching
from the other direction to fall upon their brethren
of Aheer. Quarrels of kites and crows!&mdash;Yes, to
those at a distance; but it is too much to hope that
our caravan will prove a lark's nest in some Saharan
battle-field. We must pray that a general
peace shall be proclaimed in Central Africa during
our march across the desert.<a name="page124" id="page124"></a><span class="pageno">[124]</span></p>

<p>However, we must not be frightened by rumours,
and, indeed, are not. We pass from discussion of
this warlike intelligence to bargain with Hateetah,
who, as I have hinted, seems inclined to play the
Jew, or rather&mdash;to speak in character&mdash;the Tibboo
with us. It will cost a large sum to pass through
Gh&acirc;t, and obtain an escort to Aheer. As a consolation,
we learn that we are to be persecuted by
Boro Sakontaroua, sheikh of Aghadez, who is
displeased that he has received no presents from us.
It would appear that the letters of Hassan Pasha
rather compromised us to employ him as our escort;
but I am not responsible for this, having never deviated
from the original plan of procuring an escort
from Gh&acirc;t. Indeed, I wrote to that effect immediately
on my arrival in Tripoli; and it would not
do, after keeping my friends in the oasis in a turmoil
all this while, to disappoint them. The desert
has its etiquette as well as the drawing-room,
and infringements might be rather more dangerous
here.</p>

<p>The new acting Pasha has made the Tuaricks
a present of some burnouses. This, whilst lessening
perhaps the comparative value of what we have
given, at any rate lays the chief under some obligations
to the Turks, and assists in making up a good
round sum in payment for the trouble of coming all
the way from Gh&acirc;t to Mourzuk to escort us.</p>

<p>By the way, Mr. Boro of Aghadez has been
fetched back from his encampment at Tesaoua by<a name="page125" id="page125"></a><span class="pageno">[125]</span>
a man on horseback. The business was of some
consequence, according to the notions of these people.
He had sold a female slave, and the poor woman
was now found to be <i>enceinte</i> by Boro's son, with
whom she had been living as concubine. The law
soon despatched the affair, and compelled the Sheikh
to restore the purchase-money and take back his
slave.</p>

<p>A last observation on Mourzuk, before leaving
it behind in this Saharan navigation. All the Ottoman
authorities have treated us with attention and
respect. Mr. Gagliuffi has been hospitable, and the
people generally have proved courteous in their behaviour.
It is rare to remain so long in a place and
have so few causes of complaint. Justice, however,
compels me to say, that the British Consul sometimes
remembered too vividly that he was also a merchant,
and a Levantine merchant to boot. I am afraid he
is not quite satisfied even with the profits he has
already made out of the expedition. Is it possible,
however, for Easterns, or people who live in the
East, to look upon a Government as anything but
a milch cow? Mustapha Bey, who took a very
affectionate leave of me, is now engaged in examining
a tremendous case of peculation&mdash;something
like a defalcation of two thousand mahboubs. He
is quite bewildered for the time. The Greek doctor
came to see us off; but we started in a little confusion,
for Mr. Yusuf Moknee was drunk, as he was
nearly all the time of our stay at Mourzuk.<a name="page126" id="page126"></a><span class="pageno">[126]</span></p>

<p>I left Mourzuk on the 25th of June, late in the
evening, and proceeding until midnight, stopped at
a little cluster of palms, with two or three inhabitants,
called Thurgan. Then rising at daylight,
and starting at once, I passed Om-el-Hamam, and
reached Tesaoua about nine in the evening. I found
that the Germans and the Tanelkums had gone on
in advance some days, but not so fast that we could
not hope to overtake them. The hurry and bustle
attendant on the preparations for starting has rendered
me rather indisposed; I was quite unwell on
the 27th. Next day, however, I could receive Hateetah
and the son of Shafou, and have a civil row
with them. I had to ask them whether they would
travel by night, and what they would agree to do if
any one fell sick. To the first question they promptly
answered "No, they would not;" but to the second,
that in case any one was very ill indeed, they would
wait a little for him, or travel in the night. I said
that this was not exactly what I wanted, and that
in case of sickness the expedition must be stopped.
They recommended me to go to Gh&acirc;t, and there remain
twenty days until the great heat had passed,
allowing the Tanelkums to go on. This advice is
worth reflection: but perhaps we may not suffer so
much from the heat as I anticipate. We came to a
tolerable understanding, and it was at length agreed
that we should start on the 29th.</p>

<p>The weather is now cool, the wind often blowing
<i>round</i> in the course of the day; it rarely blows<a name="page127" id="page127"></a><span class="pageno">[127]</span>
<i>through</i>, as at sea. On the way from Mourzuk we
had hot and cold blasts together; but now we are
out in the desert, we find the climate much more
temperate than in the city. I hope and pray that
I shall be able to bear up against the heat.</p>

<p>What a magnificent sky we had last night!&mdash;never
did I behold the stars in greater glory.
The Scorpion was brilliant, if not fierce; and the
constellation on his right shone splendidly. At
about eight o'clock Jupiter was setting towards the
horizon like a sun!</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;We left Tesaoua at length, at three in the
afternoon. The boat and our servants had gone on
before with the Tuaricks, who prefer not travelling
in the dark, if possible. We can often start after
them in this way, and catch them up by pushing on
some hours after sunset. Our course lay south this
evening. The heavens, before the rising of the moon,
had a most luminous appearance; Jupiter was seen
only about an hour above the horizon, and the Milky
Way was very conspicuous, but at eight o'clock described
only a small segment in the heavens.</p>

<p>We reached Sharaba at eight, and halted. This
is a sandy valley, with herbage for the camels; the
water, not very good, is a few feet from the surface,
and issues from some rocks. There are no date-palms
about the well, as reported, but a few stunted ones
are found a mile or two higher up. The surface of
the desert is broken into small mounds, crowned
with the ethel-tree.<a name="page128" id="page128"></a><span class="pageno">[128]</span></p>

<p>Sunday, the 30th, was a cool day for the desert,
yet sufficiently hot for me. We left Sharaba at a
quarter past six in the morning, and made a good
day of nine hours. These confounded Tuaricks will
travel in the heat, and encamp in the cool. At three
in the afternoon, just as the weather was becoming
quite fresh and pleasant, we halted. The wind,
occasionally strong, blew from the north-east, whilst
our course lay south-west, across a broad valley.
The sandy ground is covered with the tholukh-tree,
which affords a grateful shade in the season. This
valley is very broad here, only one side being visible
at once to the eye.</p>

<p>The Tuaricks are growing civil enough, and companionable.
Luckily Hateetah and the son of Shafou
do not drink coffee or tea&mdash;a saving. Hateetah, however,
is always begging; he says he will go to Aheer,
and appears to consider his escort indispensable.
According to him, the Germans, who are pushing
on ahead, run great danger. Yusuf tells me that
he is, in reality, extremely angry with my companions
for proceeding alone. He wishes, perhaps, to get a
present from them too; and swears that he knows
nobody but Yak&#333;b (my desert name). They are not
English, he says, but French. Besides, they have
got twenty camel-loads of goods, which he will seize
if they do not pay him something. Of course this
is all harmless bluster, and means nothing. He
confesses that, being on Fezzanee ground, he has
really no claim upon caravans at all; but he is a<a name="page129" id="page129"></a><span class="pageno">[129]</span>
greedy old rascal, and would take any advantage
he could. The same gentleman says that Sakonteroua
is only a chicken in his own country&mdash;quite
powerless; if this be the case, his enmity is not of
so much consequence as I feared.</p>

<p>The camels of the Tuaricks usually go well, and
make good hours, because they are not allowed to
eat on the road. They all march in strings, one
being tied behind the other; each string is led on
by servants or slaves. Thus, when once loaded,
there is little difficulty on the way. When seen at
a distance, they resemble a moving mass of troops,
especially when the mirage multiplies their long
files. <i>Our</i> camels, however, being all Arab camels,
cannot be made to go in strings, and are always
staring about for something whereon to browse.</p>

<p>I begin to feel better in health. If we could but
encamp for three or four hours during the heat of
the day, I have no doubt I should get on well enough.
There was talk of serpents to-day; I saw none on
this route, however. People at Mourzuk are occasionally
bitten by l&ecirc;fas and scorpions, and death
ensues often. Ammonia has been tried with success
as a cure.</p>

<p><i>July 1st.</i>&mdash;We were astir at the encampment a
little after daybreak: but it takes usually two hours
to get off, although we have but seven camels. I
hope our people will be quicker after a little more
practice. The heat was very troublesome; and
nothing could keep the Tuaricks from going on all<a name="page130" id="page130"></a><span class="pageno">[130]</span>
through the day, for ten hours and a quarter, without
stopping. Our course was along the broad wady,
which resembles an immense plain. On the surface
of its sandy bed are scattered pebbles and blocks of
sandstone and limestone, but the former chiefly.
There was nothing to please the eye but the delicate
tints of the line of sand-hills on the left&mdash;a faint yellow,
at times mingling with the sky when very luminous;
and the round tholukh-trees, scattered like
black spots on the light sand of the valley. A little
mirage figured a dark, black lake, which, however,
sparkled with light under the trees. Few animals
were seen: a young camel, left to graze in the valley,
followed us most cheerfully this morning.</p>

<p>We passed two or three wells in the course of
the day, at a place called Kouwana, with water near
the surface, and obtained some by scraping out the
sand; we did not, however, take any up, because it
was not very good. Caravans seldom use these wells.
No doubt there is water to be found everywhere
throughout the wady, which by a little care might
be turned into an oasis. Perhaps it was one in old
times. There is now no encouragement to cultivate
any stubborn ground.</p>

<p><i>July 2.</i>&mdash;Two hours in getting off again! We
started at six and went on until past five in the afternoon,
following a south-west course along the same
wady, with the same low line of sand-hills on our left,
and sand and the low edge of the plateau, which the
people say extends many days' journey, on our left.<a name="page131" id="page131"></a><span class="pageno">[131]</span>
This valley is so shallow that it might almost be
considered as part of the plateau, and is, in fact,
nearly on a level with it; the temperature tells us
we are on very high land. It is cool for this season,
and the Tuaricks even complain of chilliness at
night. Sometimes I am disposed to think the hot
weather is passed, but we must take into account
the strong breeze blowing from the north-east.</p>

<p>The broad bed of the valley is covered with
pebbles of sandstone, between which glanced a few,
very few, lizards. Rarely did any living thing cheer
our eyes as we moved along this dismal track.
Now and then gazelles, in threes and fours, went
scouring away far out of reach. One or two small
birds fluttered from stone to stone; and some crows
cawed at us from a distance. This is true Fezzan
scenery. The mirage and all its illusions cloaked
the plain in various directions, as if seeking to hide
its dull uniformity.</p>

<p>However, this desolate region has really been of
late visited by rain, as we had been told. We
encamped towards evening near a great standing
pool, which, if the weather remain moderate, will
supply the caravans for months to come. A shower
is a vulgar occurrence in Europe, received by most
men, except agriculturists, as an annoyance. In the
desert it has all the value of a heaven-sent gift. It
is shed not periodically; but at intervals of time
and place suddenly descends in copious drenchings.
We often came upon spots which had been<a name="page132" id="page132"></a><span class="pageno">[132]</span>
ploughed up as by a torrent from the skies; and
few rocks in the Sahara are without water-marks.
The rain-water at our camping-ground has an
excellent flavour, and I drank of it eagerly.</p>

<p>Round this pool we at length found the caravan
waiting for us to come up. The Germans and all
others were well, except the Sfaxee, troubled with
a little fever. Mourzuk is a bad place to break
down the health and spirits, and those that became
faint-hearted there would probably have persevered
had they got out into the bracing air of the desert.
The Tuaricks are very quiet. I sent word to
Hateetah that it was impossible for him to take
presents from the Germans, as it was contrary to
the orders of Government. Shafou's son is very
mild and circumspect.</p>

<p>Here also was Mohammed Boro, and although
I had written strongly to Tripoli about him, I
considered it advisable after all, immediately on
arriving, to try and make friends with him. So
I paid him a visit, and told him that when the
Tuaricks had conducted us to Aheer we should,
of course, place ourselves under his protection, that
we might proceed to Sakkatou. I sent him, also,
some hamsah and dates. This gladdened him
much, for he is very short of provisions, and has
many servants with him; amongst the rest, two
or three female slaves, one of whom, a fat, buxom
girl, must require prodigious nourishment.</p>

<p>When the pool of Ailouah is not filled by rain-water,<a name="page133" id="page133"></a><span class="pageno">[133]</span>
recourse is had to a well near at hand, which
supplies sufficient quantities. How important are
wells in the desert, and how one learns to mark
their existence!</p>

<p>The valley which we have been traversing three
days from Sharaba to Ailouah is called Barjouj,
and is remarkable for the tholukh-trees, which are
scattered here and there throughout its whole extent.
We are now seven days from Gh&acirc;t, and,
about the same distance from Aroukeen; but the
Tanelkums, who go slowly, make thirteen days
between this and Aroukeen. They go direct, as
we intended to do, without touching at Gh&acirc;t. Our
movements are not exactly free, but we must not
seem to notice this circumstance; and if they insist
on our taking the route by the capital, in order to
have an opportunity of increased plunder, must
give in with as good grace as possible.</p>

<p>The 2d and 3d of July we stopped at Ailouah.
Hateetah came to my tent the first day with a long
face, and said, as I foresaw, that we must all go
to Gh&acirc;t, and abide the pleasure of the Tuaricks;
also that we must wait for the return of a caravan
from Aheer. I protested against this latter pretence,
and he got up and went off in a pet. Next
morning I sent word to his tent that I could not
stay at Gh&acirc;t an indefinite period; that my means
would not allow me; and, therefore, that we must
still protest against this arrangement. He answered,
that he would assemble all the notables of Gh&acirc;t<a name="page134" id="page134"></a><span class="pageno">[134]</span>
and ask their counsel. To this I could have no
objection, and we are friends again. But I keep
as far from the Tuaricks as I can, and do not visit
them. I find this to be the best policy. We feed
them every night, and they are apparently contented.
The weather continues cool, the wind
being always partly from the north.</p>

<p>Many birds, crows and others, pretty large, were
seen about the wells of Ailouah; and a rival sportsman
to Dr. Overweg appeared in the person of
Mohammed et-Tunisee. He shot three small fowls
of Carthage, one of which he gave me, I promising
him a little powder in return when we came to
Gh&acirc;t. We noticed a small black bird with a white
throat. But all through this desert we listen in
vain for some songster. There is no reason for
merriment in these dismal solitudes.</p>

<p>Our people have dug a well, which the Tanelkums
promise to call "Bir Engleez,"&mdash;the English
Well. Good water was found easily, near the
surface at this station.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;We started late, and made only a short
day; but herbage for the camels is only found hereabouts.
Our course was, as usual, south-west over
an undulating plateau, with an horizon now near,
now distant. The surface of the ground was for the
most part blackened sand, stone pebbles, and some
blocks of very bad stone. The weather continues,
fresh and pleasant. We did not feel the heat until
some time after noon; and as we halted early at<a name="page135" id="page135"></a><span class="pageno">[135]</span>
Ghamoud, suffered nothing. The wind&mdash;which we
notice as if on ship-board&mdash;now comes always from
the east, generally with a point north. It seems to
be a sort of trade-wind throughout this portion of
the desert. I begin now to read on the camel's
back, and find this a pleasing relief from the jog-trot
monotony of the movement. I am anxious to
read the whole of the Bible in Hebrew on the
camel's back. Our friends the lizards were still
glancing along the ground in the bright sunshine,
but in diminished numbers.</p>

<p>Hateetah is always begging, and now asks for
burnouses for the Gh&acirc;t Sheikhs, Khanouhen,
Jabour, Berka, and his brother. He still pretends
that the Germans must give him a present,
and that he knows no one but the English. In
compliment, and to soothe him, I said, "You must
dress in all your fine clothes at Gh&acirc;t." This
awakened his vanity, and he seemed delighted with
the idea. His reply was, "You also must one
day dress in all your best clothes&mdash;one day&mdash;only
one day." I replied, "I have no fine clothes;" at
which he seemed puzzled. Turning the conversation,
he said I must change all his Tunisian piastres
into dollars; which I shall certainly not do. This
Consul of the English is a tremendously grasping
fellow.</p>

<p>The Tanelkums all give the son of Shafou a
good character. We parted with them this morning.
They take some loads of dates for us, and<a name="page136" id="page136"></a><span class="pageno">[136]</span>
have gone to Aroukeen, where they will wait for us
six days, and then leave us; that is, if we do not
come up. They will be twelve days, they say, on
their journey. We go by a different route to
Gh&acirc;t, and shall see but not enter Serdalous. This
place is now thickly inhabited by Tuaricks, and
Hateetah does not wish to come in contact with
them, for fear of exciting their curiosity and cupidity.
So he is a knowing old dog after all. Our
Tuaricks are displeased that the Germans have
encamped so far from us this evening. The ground
is a narrow slip of wady stretching east and west,
almost on a level with the plateau. There is a
little hasheesh (grass), with two or three young
tholukh-trees. Venus shone with uncommon
splendour this evening, eclipsing all the majesty
of Jupiter. We are looking out for the Southern
Cross, and think we see it just emerging above the
horizon ahead. In the day, the heavens have of
late been hazy.</p>

<p>They tell us, that on leaving Gh&acirc;t we shall
<i>descend</i> to Soudan; yet we can not have reached
very high ground. We may soon likewise expect
to feel the influence of the Soudan rains, and find
the atmosphere much cooler in consequence. How
the days are shortening now, and how grateful
darkness gradually expands its dominions over this
arid, scorching waste, as we move south!</p>

<p>On Friday the 5th we only advanced two hours,
to a place called Talazaghee,&mdash;a small picturesque<a name="page137" id="page137"></a><span class="pageno">[137]</span>
wady, where, during the season of rain, there are
always two or three pools of good water; there is
also now a little herbage for the camels. During
our ride we met a small slave caravan, and learned
the important intelligence that there are several
people of the Sultan En-Noor of Aheer at present
at Gh&acirc;t with slaves. This will be useful to us. I
wrote to my wife and others by this opportunity,
and trust the missives will reach their destination.
The weather is cool and pleasant to-day; and we
are led to hope that the great heat of summer is
already past. The wind followed exactly behind
us as we pursued our south-west course. On
arriving we found, rather to our surprise, the
pilgrim caravan, and our old friend Abd-el-Kader.
They have been some time reposing in Wady
Gharby collecting provisions, and, I imagine, passing
their leisure hours with the Fezzanee ladies, which
they could not very well do in Mourzuk. The morality
of these people is easy enough, and no doubt
the pilgrimage covers a multitude of sins.</p>

<p>Talazaghee is remarkable for some bas-reliefs
cut on the naked sandstone rocks of the wady, in
a very peculiar style; the principal tableau, if I
may so call it, about four feet by three in size, is a
battle between two persons, one having a bird's
head, and the other a bullock's, with a bullock
between them taking part in the fray. Each
person is holding a shield or bow. The sculptures
are mere outline, but deeply graved and well<a name="page138" id="page138"></a><span class="pageno">[138]</span>
shaped. There are several other tableaux, representing
animals, but chiefly bullocks. This would
seem to intimate, that in the days when these forms
of animals were chiselled bullocks were the animals
employed for the transport of men and merchandise
over the desert. No camels occur, as in other
tablets. These sculptures are very properly said
by our escort to be neither Arab nor Tuarick,
but belong to the people that existed before these
races. The principal tableau has a very Egyptian
look about it; the oxen are well formed, and would
do credit to a modern artist. There is one bas-relief
figure of an ox with its neck in a circle, as if
representing some of the games of the Circus. The
other animals most distinctly seen are ostriches;
the rocks around are, besides, covered with Tuarick
characters, but nothing interesting.</p>

<p>We started late on the 6th, for the Tuaricks
had allowed their camels to stray, and we waited
some time for them: however, we were obliged,
after all, to start without them, and having made
five hours and a half halted. Our course had lain
over the plateau, which about half way became
broken up into valleys. One of these, called Anan
Haghaneen, led us into the pleasant and picturesque
wady of Mana Samatanee, where only
in this part of the route can be found herbage
for camels. There are also a few tholukh-trees.
What a desolate region is all this, despite the
little spots of vegetation! There are no signs of<a name="page139" id="page139"></a><span class="pageno">[139]</span>
animal life, except traces of the wadan. For two
days, they tell us, we are to have little or no water.
Now and then we pass desert mosques,&mdash;square,
or circular, or cross-shaped walls of stone, some
with two entrances, built for the devotion of chance
passengers. The mountains on the east are called
El Magheelaghen. To-day we carried my trunk
with the money. Yusuf had previously given it in
charge to a camel-driver, and the Tuaricks were
always uneasy, asking to see if all were right.
Europeans would probably have done the same
under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>On the 7th we made a good day of about eleven
hours, continuing during the first three in shallow
wadys, down one of which we had a distant view
of the plain of Serdalous, on the north-west. Then
came the breaking up of the great plateau of
Fezzan, and we entered a pass which leads down
into the subjacent Sahara, and runs west with
an inclination to the south. This is, perhaps, one of
the most extraordinary natural features I have ever
beheld. It seems to have been purposely cut out of
the solid rock for the use of man, and reminds one
at first of a railway excavation. As we advance it
assumes the form of a cave, slightly open at top,&mdash;narrow,
winding, and furnished with seats on either
hand. A dim light comes from above. Only one
part was difficult for the boat. Now and then
the pass became quite a tunnel, but the concave
roof is high enough for any camel to pass. On the<a name="page140" id="page140"></a><span class="pageno">[140]</span>
sides, here and there, were Tuarick inscriptions;
but there was nothing remarkable revealed by this
admirable geological section. It was mostly sandstone
for the upper strata, with narrow streaks of
marl and chalk. Some slate was observed, and frequently
our way lay over beds of red clay. An
agreeable surprise awaited us occasionally, in the
shape of little openings containing groups of the
tholukh; but the general aspect of the pass was
horrible and desolate, and we eagerly pushed on
towards the end. There was nothing, apparently,
to support life; but we found and caught a young
fox: how the little wretch procured food was a
mystery which our guides could not explain. However,
life no doubt had its joys for him, and we let
him loose in the plain below. I also picked up a
dead bird, of a species common in the desert, with
white head or cap, and white tail, except the upper
feathers; all the rest, legs and bill, black. It is
about the size of a lark, but has a head like a blackbird.
We supposed the one found had died from
want of water, though it may have been killed by
the mother of the young fox.</p>

<p>On emerging from the pass at length we found
a considerable change of level, and having advanced
a little way turned back and obtained a splendid
view of the walls of the plateau, which stretched on
both sides above the plain, and thrust out lofty
bluff promontories, as into the sea. The upper lines
of some of them were perfectly straight, as if levelled<a name="page141" id="page141"></a><span class="pageno">[141]</span>
by artificial means. We came to a solitary rock on
the plain, containing excavations that seemed to be
the work of men. Here, we were told, Dr. Oudney
once stopped and breakfasted.</p>

<p>We have now a pretty correct idea of the great
central table-land of Fezzan. It is an elevation, not
quite clearly marked to the eye on some of its
northern approaches, but dropping sheer to the
plain at other parts. Mourzuk is situated in a
sandy depression on its surface, which would
probably be turned into a salt lake if there were
sufficient rain. The limits of the hollow, as of
that of many others&mdash;Wady Atbah for example&mdash;are
not noticed by the traveller. Whether he
approaches or leaves Mourzuk, he seems still to be
traversing a level plain, and only finds his mistake
by noticing the change in the nature of the ground,
the presence of marshes, of green vegetation, and of
a heavy, stifling atmosphere.</p>

to the Kasar&mdash;Perilous Adventure of Dr. Barth.</p>
</div>

<p>On the 8th we pursued our course over the monotonous
undulating plain of Taeeta, to which we had
descended. It was a little hotter, because lower
than yesterday; and the country is more parched,
more arid, more desolate, than ever. No herbage
for camels is found in these parts, and we had been
compelled to carry some with us from Wady Haghaneen,
and to wake up with dates, of which the
camels ate voraciously as a treat. Beetles and
lizards were the only living things we saw.</p>

<p>Next day, the 9th, we rose before sunrise and
made a good day of nine hours, still over the same<a name="page143" id="page143"></a><span class="pageno">[143]</span>
plain of Taeeta. About three hours before we
reached the well of Tabea we crossed the real
boundaries of the Fezzanee territory, although the
Tuaricks seem to claim the pass on the mountains
as their own. The weather was hot, there being
no wind. On these occasions the afternoons are
very oppressive, and the sun causes his power to be
unpleasantly felt until an hour before sunset.</p>

<p>From the plain to-day we had a view of the
Gh&acirc;t mountains, which seem at a distance to present
different forms and characters from the high
lands on the edge of the plateau of Mourzuk. The
bed of the undulating plain of Taeeta is covered
with pebbles and blocks, of both sand and limestone.
Yesterday I picked up some fossils of the star-fish&mdash;the
fixed star-fish, having branches by which it holds
to the bottom of the sea. Some fossils of vegetables
were also found. Two or three hours before
reaching the well we descended rapidly into a broad,
deep wady, where were the recent marks of a waterflow.
The camels all went well, ours faster than
the Targhee; but these latter, not being allowed to
stray, always make, as a rule, better and more regular
journeys.</p>

<p>The Tuaricks themselves are getting more civil.
Hateetah already enters into the idea of a treaty of
amity and commerce: he says he will fix the
amount the English merchants are to pay when
they attend the mart of Gh&acirc;t. The son of Shafou
is always represented as a very good fellow; he is<a name="page144" id="page144"></a><span class="pageno">[144]</span>
growing more and more civil and companionable.
This evening I gave him a small pair of good
scissors, which much delighted him. As for the
other Tuaricks, Hateetah excepted, I make it a rule
to refuse what they ask, otherwise I should be
annoyed every day with their importunities. Hateetah
says we must lodge at Gh&acirc;t with Haj Ahmed,
the governor, outside of the town, to be out of
the way of the begging Tuaricks. He adds,
"Always keep the door shut, and when any one
calls out for permission to enter say 'Babo,'&mdash;(No
one at home!)"</p>

<p>The Germans, like myself, find the fatigue too
great to enable them to continue their observations
and writings with regularity. We must not be
extravagant of our health and strength at this early
period of our expedition.</p>

<p>The valley of Tabea is a pleasant place, having
herbage for the camels in abundance, as is the case
wherever the ethel-tree is found. There are
several wells with water near the surface, and
others might no doubt be dug all over the wady.
Our encampment looked picturesque this evening.
It is the eve of Ramadhan, and our people fired
shots here and there to celebrate the occasion.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;A halt was arranged for this day. I
took the opportunity to wash and change all my
clothes, which I do every three or four days, if possible.
Mr. Hateetah, however, would not allow me
to carry on my domestic arrangements in peace. He<a name="page145" id="page145"></a><span class="pageno">[145]</span>
came grumbling as usual, wanting scissors, razors,
&amp;c. I cannot fill this craving abyss to the brim.
Our people fast to-day; but to-morrow, probably,
they will not, as the law does not require them to
do so when actually travelling.</p>

<p>I have left Doctors Barth and Overweg to take
the compass-direction of this route. To do this
when with them would be useless for me, but when
I leave them I must then do all the work I can.
Now, it would be only accumulating on my shoulders
useless labour. Besides, they will always do this
kind of thing much better than myself. The same
observation applies to the thermometer. It would
be well, however, if I practised taking observations
with them. But we are all sufficiently worked, and
can assist one another but little in these matters.</p>

<p>The wind has been variable for the last three
days,&mdash;in the evening, generally N.E. In the afternoon
it begins to move round, until it blows from
all the points of the compass. To-day we have hot
wind or gusts of wind. It has been very hot, 105&deg;
Fahrenheit under the tent.</p>

<p>Our people suffer much from their fasting. But
the Tuaricks do not fast, and seem to look with scorn
upon the Moors and blacks for doing so. Yusuf
says <i>he</i> shall not fast when he in <i>en route</i>. A camel
has broken down on the road, and it is found necessary to
kill it, to prevent its dying. Hateetah has
given out his decree for its sale. The Tuaricks are
to purchase half and we half of the carcase, at ten<a name="page146" id="page146"></a><span class="pageno">[146]</span>
reals, or fifty Tunisian piastres. Of our five reals
the Germans take one and a half, and the Sfaxee
a half. This will make it lighter for me. Our
people made a regular feast of the camel's flesh,
some of them sitting up and gorging till midnight.
Their noise did not disturb me, for I had slept a
good deal in the day.</p>

<p>I had done very little indeed but sleep and lie
down. We felt the heat severely at noon. A gust
of hot wind nearly carried away our tent.</p>

<p>The Tuaricks use spoons, and do not eat with
their hands like the Arabs and Turks; but the latter
pretend that the Tuaricks never wash their hands
at all, whilst they, before and after eating, always
take this precaution. In saluting, the Tuaricks do
not spread out the fingers much when they raise
their hand, but present the palm and fingers outstretched
to you. One of these gentlemen, whom I
call the noisy one, has got a poor little slave-boy,
about seven years of age, who works like a man, and
goes quite naked.</p>

<p>To-day I found a young scorpion in the canvass-case
of my writing-desk; he cocked his tail in a
hostile attitude, as if daring any one to touch him.
In his tail seems to be all his power, and so of all
the scorpion host. Yesterday was taken a locust:
this destructive insect is not bred in the desert. In
this bare and thirsty region there is nothing for the
young ones to eat, and the old ones likewise would
soon perish in the Sahara. They are bred in the<a name="page147" id="page147"></a><span class="pageno">[147]</span>
cultivated fields near the desert, or in the fertile
lands of the coast, as in the neighbourhood of Mogador,
where millions of the young have been seen,
like so many small green buds of trees.</p>

<p>Dr. Overweg made an excursion to the Gh&acirc;t
mountains, or rather the smaller hills or offshoots
from the range. He found them sandstone, but very
singularly formed or broken into huge blocks&mdash;some
like the masses which I saw on the route
from Ghadamez to Gh&acirc;t, with a very narrow base,
on which they might turn as on a pivot.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;We stopped here another day. We were
to have started in the afternoon, but the Tuaricks
had some visitors come to see them, and detained us
for their own comfort and amusement. I am not
sorry for it, as we have had a tremendous gheblee.
All the day I felt it extremely hot, and so have all
the people. I was obliged to lie down on the floor
of my tent nearly all day; but I have so arranged
my table that I put my head under it, which gives
additional and most important protection from the
sun. All these little expedients must be resorted to
in travelling over the desert, and may sometimes
save a man's life. It is surprising what protection a
piece of cloth or linen, or a piece of board, in addition
to the tent, will give against the intensity of the
sun's fierce rays. The Moors and blacks of the
coast seem to suffer as much as the Europeans.</p>

<p>There are two ways from this wady to Gh&acirc;t&mdash;a
difficult, and an easy but longer one. I and the<a name="page148" id="page148"></a><span class="pageno">[148]</span>
Germans go, with Hateetah and Shafou, the difficult
one; and we leave the heavy luggage and the caravan
to go the easy route. This, at least, is the
arrangement talked of this evening. The morrow
may bring something new.</p>

<p>The Tuaricks who arrived to-day expected a
supper: Hateetah sent to the Germans to find them
one; the Germans referred them to Moknee; and
we provided.</p>

<p>We must take care we do not have too many
customers of this sort, or we shall never get up to
Aheer with the present stock of provisions.</p>

<p>To call the wind under which we are suffering
<i>gheblee</i>, is a perfect misnomer; for the hot wind of
to-day and yesterday came directly from the <i>north</i>,
"Bahree!" As Yusuf said, however, when I told him
where the wind was from: "Where now is the sea?
It is a long way from the sea."</p>

<p>The thermometer was 106&deg; Fahrenheit in the
shade of the ethel to-day. We shall rarely have it
much hotter than this. In Bornou there is rarely
more than 104&deg; in the shade.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;Saturday.<a name="anchor5" id="anchor5"></a><a href="#footnote5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The morning is advancing
and the Tuaricks are not yet moving. These Azgher
are sad lazy dogs. It appears they have changed
their minds, and we are all to go the long and easy
way. The sun is rising in haze with a little wind.<a name="page149" id="page149"></a><span class="pageno">[149]</span>
The heavens now are frequently concealed by vapour.
Yesterday we had clouds in abundance, often shrouding
the sun&mdash;a wonder for the desert in this season!</p>

<p>We started rather late, about seven A.M., but
made a long day, continuing till sunset, or twelve
hours. Our course was north-north-west for three
or four hours, on the plain towards Serdalous, and
then entered the pass of Abulaghlagh; which, though
represented as plain and smooth as the hand by
Hateetah, was sufficiently difficult and rocky for the
boat-laden camels. The beginning of the pass was
remarkable for a number of curiously-formed sandstone
rocks, several of them swinging or resting on
a small base like a pivot, and others cleft asunder,
as straightly and clearly as if cut by a knife. Our
course along the pass was west, but when well
through it we turned round southwards towards
Gh&acirc;t.</p>

<p>Immediately on clearing the pass we saw the
celebrated Kasar Janoon, or Palace of the Demons;
of and concerning which the people had been talking
all day: we had then the range of hills or
mountains to our left, and some sand-hills on our
right. Dr. Overweg at once discovered we were in
a new region, or zone. The mountains on the left
are composed of slate-marl, and not sandstone, as
before stated by myself and Dr. Oudney. Overweg
considers them of a very peculiar character
and is delighted with their castle-like and battlemented
shapes. But we shall have much to say of<a name="page150" id="page150"></a><span class="pageno">[150]</span>
these marl-slate mountains, coloured so beautifully,
and looking nobly to the eye.</p>

<p>Before entering the pass of Abulaghlagh, Hateetah
hid some of his wheat under the rocks to
lighten his camels. I joked him, and told him I
knew his hiding-place, and would return and fetch
the wheat. All over these hills things are hidden,
and often money, which is sometimes lost for ever,
the owner dying without pointing out his hiding-place.
There was no herbage for camels to-night,
but we had brought a little hasheesh with us. A
strong wind set in towards evening and continued
nearly all night, preventing us from sleeping. We
were much exhausted by our day's march, and so
were all our animals; they suffer much from these
long stretches. We gave them dates, as we give
horses corn.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;We rose before daylight, and got off by
sunrise, continuing till about two hours after noon.
The wind was so exceedingly strong, blowing from
the south-east, that we did not feel the heat of the
sun. But now and then we had strong gusts of
hot wind, like the breath of a furnace. I tied a
thin dark cotton handkerchief over my eyes, and
found great relief.</p>

<p>Our course is now south, over a high sandy
plain. We are at length fairly in the Land of Demons,
as the country of the Gh&acirc;t Tuaricks is called
by themselves. All around, the mountains take castellated
forms, and high over all rises the Kasar<a name="page151" id="page151"></a><span class="pageno">[151]</span>
Janoon, Palace or Citadel of the Ginn: a huge
square mass of rock, said to be a day in circuit, and
bristling with turret-pinnacles, some of which must
be seven hundred feet in height. Nothing but its
magnitude can convince the eye at a distance that
it is not a work raised by human hands, and shattered
by time or warfare. Its vast disrupted
walls tower gigantically over the plain. Here, as
in another Pandemonium, the spirits of the desert
collect from places distant thousands of miles, for
the purpose of debate or prayer. It is a mosque as
well as a hall of council, and a thesaurus to boot,
for unimaginable treasures are buried in its caverns.
Poor people love to forge wealthy neighbours for
themselves. No Tuarick will venture to explore
these Titanic dwellings, for, according to old compact,
the tribes of all these parts have agreed to
abstain from impertinent curiosity, on condition of
receiving advice and assistance from the spirit-inhabitants
of their country. In my former visit I nearly
lost my life in an attempt to explore it and was supposed
to have been misled by mocking-spirits: little
did I think that this superstition was about to receive
another confirmation.</p>

<p>The Kasar Janoon, and all the mountains around,
were wrapped this day in haze, but loomed gigantically
through. We proceeded, still in sight of
this enchanted castle, over the plain, which was
perfectly bare and arid, until we arrived at Wady
Atoulah, where we found the beneficent ethel and<a name="page152" id="page152"></a><span class="pageno">[152]</span>
some good pickings for the camels. Not pausing
long here, we proceeded another hour, and encamped
in Wady Tahala, just in front of the imposing
Kasar, and full in view of the mountains of Wareerat
to the east.</p>

<p>The camels suffered much during the day's march.
The Tuaricks had another knocked up, and we two,&mdash;that
of the blacks and one which I had purchased
of Mr. Gagliuffi. The latter could not bring his
load, and we were obliged to relieve him of all his
burden; a great disappointment to me, for I bought
the animal as a strong one, to go up to Soudan. It
was a dear bargain, in comparison with the other
camels which I purchased in Mourzuk,&mdash;costing
thirty-eight mahboubs and a half. I must recover
the money, and cannot allow Government to lose
it. All our other camels came on well, even those
which cost me much less. The other is still behind
whilst I write: it is an old, worn-out, black Egyptian
camel, and cost only eighteen dollars.</p>

<p>I did not feel so much exhausted to-day as usual.
I always take tea and coffee on encamping, which
restores my senses at least, and does me much good
generally. I dissolve mastic with the water during
the hot hours, and to-day drank at least three pints,
but ate little.</p>

<p>The well is east from our encampment two hours,
and under the mountains. There is encamped the
Sfaxee, who went by the more difficult route, to
arrive at Gh&acirc;t before us; but it seems he will be<a name="page153" id="page153"></a><span class="pageno">[153]</span>
disappointed. He came by the pass by which I
returned formerly from Gh&acirc;t to Mourzuk,&mdash;certainly
too difficult and narrow for the transport of
the boat.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;I rose early, and marched about three
hours and a half to the well, under the Kasar
Janoon; that is to say, four or five miles along the
base of the eastern wall of the Kasar. But this
day's adventures deserve more particular chronicle.</p>

<p>The Germans had determined to go and examine
the Kasar, and were about to start just as I came
out of my tent. They had had some altercation with
Hateetah, because, partly for superstitious reasons,
he would not give them a guide, and they had made
up their minds to undertake the exploration alone.
I saw Dr. Barth going off somewhat stiffly by himself;
Dr. Overweg came to where I was standing,
and asked Amankee, my Soudan servant, about the
well near the Kasar, and then also went off. He
said to me, "I shall boil the water on the highest
point, and then go along the top to the other end."
He was taking some points of the Kasar with the
compass, and I observed to him, "Take the eastern
point." Then he started. Yusuf called out after
him, "Take a camel with you, it is very distant."
Distressed at seeing them go alone, I told Amankee
that if he would follow I would give him a present.
He agreed, upon the condition that he should not
be expected to ascent the Kasar; for he feared the<a name="page154" id="page154"></a><span class="pageno">[154]</span>
Janoon. We then gave him dates, biscuits, and a
skin of water, and he started after Dr. Overweg.
I confess I had my fears about them. On arriving
near the well, we pitched tent near an immense
spreading old ethel, which afforded us some shade.
I watched the changing aspect of the Kasar nearly
all the time of our three hours' ride; and could not
help thinking that the more it was examined the
more marvellous did it appear. I then looked out
to recognise the place where I was lost four years
ago, and at last I thought I could distinguish the
locality. The day wore on. It blew gales of hot
wind. No Germans appeared, although it had
been told them that we should only stop during the
hot hours of the day. However, I anticipated that
they would not arrive before sunset. Hateetah sent
word, that as there was little water he should not
move on till to-morrow. This was good news for
the Germans.</p>

<p>At last, about five o'clock P.M., Dr. Overweg
appeared. He had experienced great thirst and
fatigue; but, having the assistance of Amankee, he
got back safe. He at once confessed his fears for
Dr. Barth. I began to think this gentleman must
either have gone to Gh&acirc;t, or that some accident had
befallen him. Soon, indeed, we began to have
gloomy apprehensions, and to talk seriously of a
search. The Tuaricks were not very civil, and
Hateetah threw all the responsibility of the safety of<a name="page155" id="page155"></a><span class="pageno">[155]</span>
my fellow-travellers on me. Dr. Overweg and
several people went out in search of Dr. Barth just
before sunset.</p>

<p>Night closed in; no appearance of our friend.
I hoisted a lamp on the top of the ethel, and
made large fires as the sun went down, in hopes
that their glare might be seen at a distance from
the Kasar. Our servants returned without Dr.
Overweg. He had promised to be back by sunset,
and I began to fear some accident had befallen
him likewise.</p>

<p>The evening grew late, and Hateetah came to me,
in a very nervous state, to inquire after the Germans.
I endeavoured to compose him by telling him the
responsibility was on us, and not on him. Dr.
Overweg returned at midnight. He had thrown
into the desert various pieces of paper, on which
was written the direction of our encampment from
the Kasar. We were very uneasy, and slept little,
as may be imagined; but before we retired for the
night Hateetah arranged a general search for the
morning.</p>

<p>Next morning, accordingly, at daybreak (16th),
the search was commenced, by two camels scouring
the environs of the desert. Dr. Overweg went with
one of the parties, but returned at noon, bringing no
news of Dr. Barth. Amankee with his party had,
however, seen his footsteps towards the north.
This was most important, as it directed our attention
that way, and we thought no more of his having<a name="page156" id="page156"></a><span class="pageno">[156]</span>
gone to Gh&acirc;t. We now calculated that our companion
had been twenty-four hours without a drop
of water, a gale of hot wind blowing all the time!
Dr. Overweg proposed to me that we should offer
a considerable reward, as the last effort. He
mentioned twenty, but I increased the sum to
fifty dollars. This set them all to work, and a
Tuarick with a maharee volunteered to search.
I found it necessary, however, to give him two
dollars for going, besides the proffered reward;
he left at two P.M., and all the people were sent off
by Hateetah a couple of hours after him.</p>

<p>This was a dreadfully exciting day. I confess,
that as the afternoon wore on I had given up nearly
all hope, and continued the search merely as a matter
of duty. Few will be able to imagine the anguish
of losing a friend under such circumstances
in the wide desert, where you may for ever remain
uncertain how he came by his death, whether by the
spear of a bandit, the claws of a wild beast, or by
that still more deadly enemy, thirst. Just before
sunset I was preparing fresh fires as a last resort,
when I saw one of our blacks, the little Mahadee,
running eagerly towards the encampment. Good
news was in his very step. I hastened to meet him.
He brought the joyful intelligence that Dr. Barth
had been found, still alive, and even able to speak!
The Tuarick whom I had despatched, in scouring
the country with his maharee, had found him about
eight miles from the camp, lying on the ground,<a name="page157" id="page157"></a><span class="pageno">[157]</span>
unable to move. For twenty-four hours he had
remained in the same position, perfectly exhausted
with heat and fatigue. Our fires had not been unmarked
by him, but they only served to show that
we were doing our best to find him. He could not
move a step towards them. On seeing his deliverers,
he could just muster strength to say, "Water, water!"
He had finished the small supply he had taken
with him the day before at noon, and had from that
time suffered the most horrible tortures from thirst.
He had even drunk his own blood! Twenty-eight
hours, without water in the Sahara! Our people
could scarcely at first credit that he was alive; for
their saying is, that no one can live more than
twelve hours when lost in the desert during the
heats of summer.</p>

<p>Dr. Barth was now brought back to the camp.
He had still a supply of biscuit and dates with
him; but eating only aggravates the torture of
thirst. Moist food is fitter to carry on such occasions.
We found rum very useful in restoring his
health.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;The Doctor, being of robust constitution,
was well enough this day to mount his camel, and
proceed with the caravan. We advanced about
seven hours, and then encamped. To-morrow, a
ride of a couple of hours will take us into Gh&acirc;t.</p>

</div>

<p>We were up early on the morning of the 18th, and
prepared to make our official approach to the town
of Gh&acirc;t, which was now distant only two hours. I
had already visited the place, and was familiar with
its aspect; but must introduce a few words of description
for the sake of the reader of the present
narrative. Gh&acirc;t is situated on the spur of a lofty
hill, which overlooks it from the north. It is surrounded
by miserable walls not more than ten feet
high, pierced by six weak gates. The houses are
not whitewashed, like those of Moorish towns, but
retain the dirty hue of the unburnt brick and mud
with which they are built. A single minaret worthy<a name="page159" id="page159"></a><span class="pageno">[159]</span>
the name, and one large building used as a general
lodging-house, rise above the flat roofs of the rest
of the town. Some few palm-trees bend gracefully
here and there; but, in general, the groves of the
oasis are a little distant from the walls. There is a
suburb of some fifty houses of stone and mud; and
a number of huts, made of straw and palm-branches.
The whole oasis is not more than three miles in
extent; the gardens produce only a little wheat,
barley, and ghaseb, with some few kinds of fruit.
Good water is supplied by wells; but all the palm
vegetation is stunted.</p>

<p>From the hill that overlooks the town, a fine
view is to be obtained of the little oasis and the vast
extent of desert that encircles it on every side. Far
to the south wave in the air the summits of the
palm-groves of Berket, on the way to Aheer. To
the west, hills and ridges succeed one another to
the horizon; and to the east, above a line of glittering
sand-hills, rises the unbroken wall of the Wareerat
range&mdash;the rampart thrown up by the demons to
protect their favourite Tuaricks from the inroads of
the conqueror. The contrast of the bright green of
the oasis with the stony waste beyond is striking;
and when the sun sheds its bright rays over the
scene, it may really be called beautiful.</p>

<p>But these are reminiscences. This day, as soon
as we saw the town appearing over the trees
between the rocks, we hailed it with delight; not,
however, as the termination, but as the starting-point<a name="page160" id="page160"></a><span class="pageno">[160]</span>
of a journey. Beyond, southward, everything
to us was unknown, and, we believed, to all
Europeans. Every step further, then, promised to
be a discovery. Should we be allowed to proceed unmolested?
Would no obstacle, natural or artificial,
intervene? Much would depend on our reception
in Gh&acirc;t. On my former visit I had not, on the
whole, reason to complain of the Sheikhs of the
Tuaricks, whose chief place this is. I remembered
the venerable Shafou, the dashing Khanouhen,
with Jabour, and all the others, from whom I had
received what might be called kindness. Hateetah,
it is true, had hitherto somewhat disappointed me;
and I know that great expectation had been already
aroused in this little secluded territory of profit to
be made out of my mission. Whether I should be
able to meet all demands was a serious question
with me. I am pleased to say that the Governor's
son came out to meet us, and conduct us to the
housed of his father, who, with several of the notables
of Gh&acirc;t, were assembled, and gave us, in truth, a
cordial reception.</p>

<p>It may be as well to remind the reader that
Gh&acirc;t is a small town which has grown up in the
territory of the Azgher Tuaricks, in consequence
of the convenience of the place as a station for the
caravans from Soudan Proper, and other points of
Central Africa. It is inhabited principally by
people of Moorish origin, but mixed and known as
Gh&acirc;teen. Haj Ahmed, the governor, is also a<a name="page161" id="page161"></a><span class="pageno">[161]</span>
Moor, born at Tuat. He is a marabout, or saint,
but is looked up to by the people for the settlement
of all municipal concerns. The Gh&acirc;teen
derive their subsistence almost entirely from the
caravans, although their little oasis is not unfertile.</p>

<p>But the political authority of the country resides
entirely in the hands of the Azgher Tuaricks.
Azgher is the name of the tribe or nation, and
Tuarick is a generic title, which scarcely implies
even community of origin, assumed by nearly all
the wandering people of the Sahara. There are
the Haghar Tuaricks, to the west of Gh&acirc;t and
south-west towards Timbuctoo; and the corresponding
people of Aheer are called the Kailouee Tuaricks.
At Timbuctoo itself are found the Sorghau
Tuaricks.</p>

<p>The chief of the Tuaricks of Gh&acirc;t is nominally
the venerable Shafou, whose son came with Hateetah
to escort me from Mourzuk; but the virtual
sultanship resides in Khanouhen, the heir-apparent,
or son of Shafou's sister: for this is the order of
succession in Gh&acirc;t. Every Tuarick, however, is
in some sort a chief, and more or less influence is
acquired by age or personal qualities. The principal
men have divided the sources of emolument
which the peculiar position of their country supplies
them with. Hateetah claims to afford protection to
all private English travellers, and to receive presents
from them; another patronises the inhabitants
of Tripoli, a third those of Soudan, and so on.<a name="page162" id="page162"></a><span class="pageno">[162]</span>
This arrangement enables a visitor to the place to
calculate with some certainty about the amount of
obligation he incurs. All the Tuaricks are easily
distinguished by their habit of wearing a litham,
or muffler, with which they conceal their mouths
and all the lower part of their face. This custom
gives them a strangely mysterious appearance.</p>

<p>The house of Haj Ahmed, the governor, to
which we were conducted, is situated three parts of
a mile from the town, which I did not enter during
my stay. It would not have done to expose myself
to the familiar impudence of the people, who had
known me during my visit under very different circumstances.
Besides, my time was fully taken up
with business matters; so fully, that I scarcely had
time even to write one or two brief despatches to
Government.</p>

<p>On the morning of our arrival at Gh&acirc;t all
seemed to promise well. The Governor welcomed
us with hospitality, and his slaves unloaded our
camels, and quickly conducted us to our apartments.
At noon, although it was Ramadhan time, we received
some dishes of meat, with figs, grapes, and
molasses&mdash;really a sumptuous repast. We were
not allowed to go out the first day.</p>

<p>The next morning there was a general meeting
of the Sheikhs and people of the town in our apartments;
and from the turn affairs began to take, we
found it necessary to despatch a courier to Aroukeen,
to beg the Tanelkums to wait a few days for us at<a name="page163" id="page163"></a><span class="pageno">[163]</span>
that place. During the meeting began the first
prevarication of the Tuaricks. The son of Shafou
said that he did not agree to conduct us to Aheer&mdash;an
assertion we contradicted strongly. At length
he exclaimed: "Although I did not agree to this, I
will nevertheless conduct you,"&mdash;making a new
favour of an old bargain.</p>

<p>When the meeting separated, there was another
affair brought on the carpet by Hateetah and
Waled Shafou. They boldly demanded seventy
reals, or small dollars of Gh&acirc;t, for the passage of
our liberated blacks to Soudan. I declared that I
would not give them a real, and told them to seize
the people if they chose. Hateetah upon this
went off in a rage, and Waled Shafou stayed
behind, pretending to seize our servants. We did
not take any notice of him, and at last he likewise
departed. Mr. Gagliuffi had not been able to arrange
this affair at Mourzuk,&mdash;it being left in this position,
"that they (Hateetah and Shafou) would say
nothing about the matter; but that if others did, we
should pay a little." The man who has a right to
this tribute from freed blacks is now absent from
Gh&acirc;t, and any claim ought to be made in his name
by his representatives. When the Governor heard
of this affair, he sent to tell us "to arrange the
matter, and give something to these dogs of Tuaricks;"
at the same time expressing his sorrow for
such a shameful demand: and shameful it was,
because we had already paid for ourselves and our<a name="page164" id="page164"></a><span class="pageno">[164]</span>
servants three hundred reals. Besides this sum,
Hateetah and Waled Shafou had each of them
received a present of about a hundred mahboubs.
Finally my friend, Haj Ibrahim, the merchant,
undertook to arrange this business, and paid on our
account twenty-eight reals more for our servants.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th there was another
general meeting, and I presented the treaty for consideration.
A long discussion followed, but I at
first misunderstood the conclusion to which the
Sheikhs came. However, the following day we
had a regular debate, the result of which was that
the Sheikhs and heads of the town declared they
could not come to a final arrangement until the
winter souk (market), when all the notables would
be assembled.</p>

<p>A great deal of unpleasant discussion occurred
during all these meetings, and I had to fight my way
step by step. The Shereef was first on my side, but
as I had promised him a present only if the treaty
were signed, and as he saw that this would not take
place, he turned round and became my active enemy.
However, it was out of his power to do me much
harm. The greater part of the last days of my
stay were spent in agitation about the presents for
Jabour, Khanouhen, Berka, and others, some of
whom were absent. I said that nothing could be
given until the Sheikhs and the people of Gh&acirc;t did
something for the Queen&mdash;for the presents were
the Queen's presents. Finally, the day before our<a name="page165" id="page165"></a><span class="pageno">[165]</span>
departure, a great uproar was made on this subject,
and I was obliged to yield the point, and give them
burnouses. These presents had been promised to
Hateetah on the road from Mourzuk to Gh&acirc;t, upon
the condition that the Sheikhs and people would
agree to the treaty. They had also been mentioned
at Mourzuk; but then, nothing had been said about
conditions. I considered it highly impolitic to
allude to the treaty in the hearing of the Turks,
who would have thought I was secretly going to
enter into an alliance offensive and defensive with
the Gh&acirc;teen against them. The Tuaricks, however,
stood upon the point, that when the burnouses were
promised first, there was no talk of an equivalent,
and I was obliged to concede.</p>

<p>When I had finished distributing these presents,
there was peace for the few hours that we were yet
to remain at Gh&acirc;t. Haj Ahmed, however, seeing
and hearing of all this confusion, became alarmed
lest I should repeat it to Mourzuk, and refused to
take the presents of tea, coffee, sugar, a white burnouse,
and a few large carpet-rugs, which I offered
him. His son, also, refused what I tendered, a fez
and a turban, because it was not enough. Everybody
in Gh&acirc;t who expected a present from us,
seemed determined to be satisfied with nothing less
than a burnouse. The Governor wished to appear
perfectly disinterested amidst this confusion and
these extortionate demands of the Tuaricks. I was
not sorry for the refusals, for really I have ten thousand<a name="page166" id="page166"></a><span class="pageno">[166]</span>
people to give presents to before I return from
the interior.</p>

<p>I do not consider that, after all, Haj Ahmed
treated us so well as he might have done. The first
dinner was good; but the others were poor, and
some of it I could not eat at all. He was disappointed
at my not bringing him a printed Koran;
but I could not, on this occasion, make such a present.</p>

<p>Hateetah, in all these disputes at Gh&acirc;t, has
acted a double part. Publicly he was our enemy;
but privately he pretended to be our greatest
friend. He was imitated in his conduct by the
son of Shafou, who seemed to look upon him as his
Mentor. On leaving, Hateetah promised that I
should see something wonderful which he would do
for me, speaking of the treaty. I am afraid that
not much reliance can be placed on these fine promises.</p>

<p>On the morning fixed for my departure, the
Sheikhs and Haj Ahmed, seeing me much grieved,
out of health and out of temper, all came forward to
try and repair any mischief they might have done
me and their own reputation. They begged me to
leave the treaty with them, and promised faithfully
in the assembly of all the Sheikhs, in the winter, to
do their best to gratify the wishes of the British
Government. They also undertook to write private
letters themselves, especially Hateetah. Haj Ibrahim,
to whom I presented a watch worth twenty dollars,<a name="page167" id="page167"></a><span class="pageno">[167]</span>
also promised to render me all his assistance and
influence with the Sheikhs, and to be my wakeel
(agent) in my absence. Jabour paid me a farewell
visit, and after he received his present was very
polite and jocular. Yusuf Moknee, as a Tripoline,
also paid him six reals; for he is the official protector
of people from that city, as well as some
others. The day before, one of his people had seized
my Fezzanee servant because he did not give the
usual presents, viz. a barracan and common fez.
He was put to "working in water," as they call it;
that is, to assist in irrigating one of the gardens.
After a short time, however, they allowed him to
return to me. Such are the Tuaricks&mdash;grasping,
violent, and capricious! I cannot, however, until I
see the fate of the treaty, completely decide upon
the conduct of Hateetah and the body of Sheikhs
generally.</p>

<p>Mahommed Kafa was one of our best friends at
Gh&acirc;t, and had always a smile to greet us with&mdash;a
great relief in a country where most of the people
you meet have a frown on their brows and their
mouths closely muffled up. This man is the most
considerable merchant of Gh&acirc;t, and exerted himself
greatly to procure us an escort of Kailouees. I
gave a white burnouse to him and his son. They
both sent us a dinner. We were fortunate in finding
a party of Kailouees here on their way to Aheer.
They have agreed to act as escort, which renders us
in some measure independent of the son of Shafou.<a name="page168" id="page168"></a><span class="pageno">[168]</span></p>

<p>During my residence at Gh&acirc;t I received a visit
from my old friend Ouweek, and also from the old
bandit whose acquaintance I made at Ghadamez.
Ouweek was very complimentary, and shook me
cordially by the hands. He observed, "There is no
fear in this country; go on in advance: this country
is like Fezzan." I then brought him out some
tobacco, and a handkerchief to wrap it in. As usual,
he did not seem satisfied with this; so I added a
loaf of white sugar. He then noticed Yusuf, and
thus addressed him: "Yusuf! I have heard that
Hateetah and the son of Shafou are about to conduct
these Christians to Soudan. I am a better man
than them all! Now Hateetah and Waled Shafou
will want this sugar and tobacco on the road. I
leave it for them." On this he started up on two
sticks, for he is doubly lame, having the Guinea-worm
in both legs, and went away hurriedly. I,
however, sent the sugar and tobacco after him, and
this time he condescended to accept them. He
came to see me mounted on his maharee (or
dromedary).</p>

<p>To the old bandit of Ghadamez I also presented
some tobacco, and he went his way. Fortunately
there were few Tuaricks in Gh&acirc;t at this time, otherwise
I should have had hosts of such visitors. The
absence of these grasping chiefs has interfered, it is
true, with the treaty of commerce; but it is possible,
that even had Khanouhen been present some other
shift would have been discovered. There are now<a name="page169" id="page169"></a><span class="pageno">[169]</span>
present in Gh&acirc;t only the Sheikh Jabour, Waled
Shafou, Sheikh Hateetah, Sheikh Ouweek, and
Haj Ahmed, the governor of the town. The Sultan
Shafou himself is on the road to Soudan, and we
shall probably meet him in a few days on our way.
I have, however, sent this aged chieftain a handsome
sword from the English Government, by his son,
to whom I gave it in one of the public meetings.</p>

<p>With reference to the treaty, it may, perhaps,
be considered in a fair way to be finally accepted.
At the winter souk every person of influence and
authority in the country will be present, and in the
form in which I have presented it, I believe it will
provoke little or no opposition. The clauses with
reference to religion and the slave-trade have, of
course, been left out; the first as unnecessary, the
second as dangerous at this early stage of our proceedings.
Even already it may be said that the
market at Gh&acirc;t may safely be visited by British
merchants; for although Hateetah may require
heavy presents, he will certainly protect them.</p>

<p>However, we must bear in mind, that in a
country governed in so irregular way, it is very
difficult to answer for the future. The governor,
Haj Ahmed himself, told me in a deprecating manner,
"Gh&acirc;t is a country of Sheikhs!" and Hateetah
says, half jocularly, "Gh&acirc;t has thirty Sultans!"
Fortunately, however, it is the interest of the rulers
of this part of the desert to encourage traffic; they<a name="page170" id="page170"></a><span class="pageno">[170]</span>
live by it; otherwise it would be dangerous to trust
to their assurances.</p>

<p>We were in all but seven days in Gh&acirc;t, so that I
had no time to make researches. However, I am
fortunate in procuring a collection of dialogues and
a vocabulary of most of the common words in the
Tuarick dialect of the tribes in Gh&acirc;t. I employed
for this purpose Mohammed Shereef, nephew of
the Governor of Gh&acirc;t, who is a pretty good Arabic
scholar. I have also made an arrangement with
my friend Haj Ibrahim to forward to the British
Government a small quantity of Soudan manufactures
for the Exhibition of 1851; so that the
industry and handicraft of the dusky children of
Central Africa may be represented side by side with
the finished works of Paris and London artisans.<a name="anchor6" id="anchor6"></a><a href="#footnote6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

traveller was so fully occupied by various kinds of business during
his stay, that he was not able to write, and only threw upon paper a
rough memorandum after he had started on his way to Aheer. The
imperfection is the less to be regretted, as, up to this point, the
Sahara had previously been pretty well travelled and described. He
now breaks fresh ground, and is more copious in his notes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p>The departure from Gh&acirc;t was, for most of us,
an exciting moment. So far I had considered
myself comparatively on familiar ground; for although
I had followed different routes, the great
points of Mourzuk and Gh&acirc;t were well known to
me. Now, however, we were about to enter upon
a region totally unknown, of which no authentic
accounts from eye-witnesses&mdash;unless we count the
vague reports of natives&mdash;had ever reached us;
valleys unexplored; deserts unaffronted; countries
which no European had ever surveyed. Before us,
somewhere in the heart of the Sahara, raised into<a name="page172" id="page172"></a><span class="pageno">[172]</span>
magnificence perhaps by the mirage of report, was
the unknown kingdom of Aheer, of which Leo
Africanus hints something, but the names of whose
great cities are scattered as if at haphazard over
the maps, possibly hundreds of miles out of their
right position. What reception shall we meet with
in that untried land? In what light will its untravelled
natives&mdash;fierce from ignorance and bigotry&mdash;regard
this mission of infidels, coming from
latitudes of which they have never dreamed, with
objects unappreciable and perhaps hostile? Will
nature itself be hospitable? Are there no enemies
in the climate, no perils peculiar to the seasons?
These questions occupied my mind as the caravan
wound between the last palm-groves of Gh&acirc;t; and
my camel, resuming its swinging march, went away
with its neck advanced like a bowsprit over this
desert sea, which might be scattered with hidden
dangers at every step.</p>

<p>The wind does not always serve at the outset of
a voyage. Our first stage was only of two hours
southwards, as far as Berket, a considerable town,
well walled, situate under a low hill, and surrounded
with palm-trees and gardens. The people visited
us on our arrival; all proved troublesome and some
insolent. I had heard a better account of them.
Their country is pleasanter than themselves, certainly
the most picturesque piece of desert I have
seen since leaving Tripoli. A range of lofty black
mountains extends on the east, with mounds of sand<a name="page173" id="page173"></a><span class="pageno">[173]</span>
and smaller hills at their base, dotted with the beautiful
ethel-tree; palms rise in abundance on all sides;
gardens surround the wells; and animals feed about
on the plain. The scenery is quite rich, and even suggests
the idea of fertility. The Tuaricks possess
many similar fine valleys.</p>

<p>We started late next day from Berket, and made
only four hours to a well. Here it was necessary to
wait for Waled Shafou, and the three extra camels
which we have hired to go with us to Aheer. The
scenery resembles that of yesterday; but there is not so
much herbage, and the palms are absent. Probably
the date-palms of Berket are the last trees of this
species which we shall see until our return. The
olive-district has long ago been left behind; and
now the columnar date-palm is also to be among
the things that were. They report, however, that
there is a diminutive species in Aheer. We shall
greet this dwarf-cousin of our old friend with pleasure.</p>

<p>We are on our way to meet the Kailouee
Tuaricks, with whom we have arranged in Gh&acirc;t
to conduct us by Aheer to Zinder&mdash;a service for
which we have already paid a hundred dollars of
the money of Gh&acirc;t. They are a company of
merchants returning to their own country, and although
they will probably protect us to a certain
extent, can scarcely inspire so much confidence as
Waled Shafou would have done. We travelled four
hours on the 26th. Dr. Barth was again lost this<a name="page174" id="page174"></a><span class="pageno">[174]</span>
evening, having pushed on in his usual eager way
for about half an hour. We were filled with alarm.
There were two roads dividing at a certain place,
one direct and the other turning off at an angle.
Naturally, the Doctor followed the straight road,
which proved to be the wrong one. However,
knowing he had gone on before, my fears were
awakened when we reached the fork; and I immediately
fired several guns, and ordered a search
to be commenced. The guns not only served as
guides to Dr. Barth, but introduced us to the
Kailouees, who were close at hand, and came running
to meet us. Their appearance, for I scarcely know
what reason, sent a thrill of joy through our frames;
and the weariness and discouragement we had
brought with us from Gh&acirc;t disappeared. We entertained
great hopes of these new companions.
The first impression they produced was good; for
they greeted us most cheerfully, and began helping
to unload the camels. They have several female
slaves with them, and muster in all some twenty
persons and about thirty camels; so that, altogether,
we shall form a very respectable caravan.</p>

<p>We rose early on the 27th, and starting at half-past
six, continued moving until noon, when we
encamped in a valley a little before the water of
Akourou, where there is herbage for the camels in a
hollow amidst rocky sandstone hills. The scenery
of this part of the desert continues to be very
varied. The range of lofty marl hills, over which<a name="page175" id="page175"></a><span class="pageno">[175]</span>
the sun rises for Gh&acirc;t, is still seen stretching
northwards and southwards. Animals feed about
here and there; some quails whirr along the
ground; black vultures, white eagles, and numerous
crows, perch upon the rocks, or speckle the sky
overhead. I went to visit the "Water," as they
call a small lake that nestles amidst the rocks. It
is of some depth, and filled, they say, merely by
rain-water, very palatable to drink. Even when
no showers occur for several years it does not
become quite empty; and as there is no apparent
reason for this, I am led to suppose it may be partly
fed by some spring in the rocks that form its bed.
This lake imparts an unusually cheerful aspect to
the valley in which it lies. It is resorted to by the
dwellers of the neighbouring district, who come to
water their flocks, and feed them on the herbage
that springs round the margin. These pools or
collections of water are called ghadeer, which I at
first mistook for the name of a particular locality.
According to Yusuf, this place gives an exact idea
of the Tibboo country, where, he says, there are no
wells, but vast clefts in the rock, down which pours
the water when it rains, to collect in the hollows
at the bottom. Our people speak with great respect
of this ghadeer. Everything connected with water
is sacred in the desert. They say that for several
weeks after a rain-storm there are regular cascades
over the rocks.</p>

<p>Next day we advanced in six hours to a wady<a name="page176" id="page176"></a><span class="pageno">[176]</span>
similar to that we had left; curiously shaped sandstone
rocks showed themselves on all sides: no
fossils were discovered. Asses in droves were seen
feeding about. The Tuaricks possess a good number
of these useful animals, brought from Soudan,
of a finer breed than those at Mourzuk. All the
domestic animals of the country are from the same
place&mdash;the horses, bullocks used to draw the water
from the wells, as well as the sheep and asses.
Gh&acirc;t, indeed, is within the circle of Soudan influence;
the people dress in Soudan clothes; eat
off Soudan utensils; and mingle a great deal of the
Soudan language with their Tuarick dialect. We
feel, therefore, as if we were now going towards a
centre instead of from a centre. Mourzuk, on the
contrary, holds itself in connexion with the Arabs
of the coast; and seems to receive no influence from
the interior except by means of the Tibboos, who
form a kind of connecting link. There is a considerable
sprinkling of this curious people in the
lower portions of the population of Mourzuk, and
there are always some genuine specimens to be met
with in the streets. It may be said, however, that
both the capital of Fezzan and Gh&acirc;t itself seem
rendezvous from all parts of Africa; and I imagine,
that in all the souk (market) cities of the interior
the same fact will be observed. However, it will
remain true, no doubt, that south of Gh&acirc;t the influence
of Soudan will be far more sensibly marked
than on the other side.<a name="page177" id="page177"></a><span class="pageno">[177]</span></p>

<p>The son of Shafou, Mahommed Wataitee, who
seems to have made up his mind to shirk the
journey to Aheer, left us this morning to go to
Aroukeen and meet his father, who is encamped
with his flocks and dependants around that well.
No doubt it is fashionable in Gh&acirc;t land to be "out
of town" at this season of the year. Our Kailouees
have determined to take another and more direct
road, avoiding Aroukeen and the Azgher Tuaricks
in its neighbourhood. Waled Shafou says, he shall
fall in with us somewhere about Falezlez; but this
seems somewhat doubtful. When people separate in
the desert they must not calculate on meeting again
in a hurry. We parted about three hours from the
water of Akourou, the road to Aroukeen branching
off there. He took the easterly route and we the
westerly, and we were soon out of sight. Our way
still lay through desert-hills, but with vegetation
frequently. There was talk of the small oasis of
Janet to our left; and we indulged in some pastoral
reflections on the life of contemplative ease
and primitive simplicity which would be indulged
in in such an out-of-the way place.</p>

<p>We seem to have got into some scrape with the
Kailouees. Besides the hundred dollars which Haj
Ibrahim paid them to conduct us from Aheer to
Zinder, it appears he promised them some burnouses,
when we have none for them. They mentioned
the subject to-day, very naturally. We must do as
well as we can. They seem civil enough; but an<a name="page178" id="page178"></a><span class="pageno">[178]</span>
incident has just occurred which has much displeased
me.</p>

<p>It appears that when these people came to Gh&acirc;t,
a few weeks ago, they left a sick slave with some
shepherds among these rocks. To-day they inquired
about the slave, whether she was dead, or what had
become of the poor thing; but the shepherds
refused to give any account,&mdash;said, in fact, they knew
nothing about the matter. Upon this the Kailouees
seized a black boy belonging to these poor people
and dragged him along, with a rope round his neck,
to terrify him into confessing what had become of
the slave. The poor boy, however, had nothing to
confess; so at last, after they had dragged him for
some distance, they let him go. Such is a specimen
of the incidents which almost daily occur, arising
out of this horrible traffic. I lectured one of the
Kailouees on the subject, and told him that we were
in Tuarick territory, and that such an action might
bring the genuine Tuaricks upon us.</p>

<p>It would appear that the governor of the town
of Aghadez, or rather of the whole Kailouee race,
is not known, there having lately been a revolution
in this Saharan region. All the country is up in
arms. We shall arrive at the interesting crisis
of a change of dynasty. The two Sultans of Aheer
known, are our friends En-Noor and Lousou.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;We rose at daybreak and soon started,
ascending from the valley through a difficult pass
to a rocky plateau, over which we pursued our undeviating<a name="page179" id="page179"></a><span class="pageno">[179]</span>
track for more than nine hours, and pitched
our tents in a small and nameless wady, covered
with a sprinkling of herbage. This was a trying
day for the camels, the ground being rough with
loose stones. How different is all this from European
notions of a desert, or level expanse of sand!
With some few exceptions, the Sahara is a region
covered by comparatively low, rocky hills, forming
valleys here and there, supplied with trees, and
herbage, and water. We are now in a really uninhabited
spot; scarcely a bird is seen, or a lizard, or
a beetle, or any living thing, save a few flies that
still follow the caravan on unwearied wing, and
buzz with moderated ferocity about the noses of the
camels.</p>

<p>What fantastic forms did the rock assume to-day!
Now its pinnacles bristled up like a forest of
pines; now there seemed to rise the forms of castles
and houses, and even groups of human beings. All
this is black sandstone&mdash;hideously black, unlovely,
unsociable, savage-looking. 'Tis a mere wilderness
of rock, thrown in heaps about, with valleys, or
trenches, or crevices, through which the caravan
slowly winds. This is our first cloudy day. May
we have many such! We feel little of the sun's
power, although there is little or no wind. We
must have reached a considerable elevation.</p>

<p>I begin to find it necessary to keep a tight rein
over our servants, otherwise our encampment and
party would always be in disorder. Mohammed<a name="page180" id="page180"></a><span class="pageno">[180]</span>
Tunisee is a very impertinent fellow at times, and
is capable of spoiling all the others. This evening
I gave the Kailouees and their servants a treat of
coffee, which much delighted them. Amongst the
rest was En-Noor's servant. We get on very well
with them for the present.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;We made five hours of very difficult road,
winding nearly all the way through a ravine of the
rocky plateau, and finally descended by a precipitous
path, among some rocks, to a small lake or pool
enclosed within immense cliffs of rock, called the
Egheree Water. It is produced solely by rain.
Within ten minutes of this, between the cliffs, is
another three times the size, and of the same origin.
All about, moreover, there are little pools of water
sparkling amongst the rocks, left by the recent rain.
We encamped in a narrow wady, called Ajunjer,
further on; and propose to remain during the rest
of the day and to-morrow. It has been cool to-day,
with wind; the sky clear, of a deep blue. In the
rocky valley we observed a species of hedge-thorn,
called jad&#257;ree; also many of the fine large-leafed
plants, called baranbakh; and the sweet-smelling
sheeah, that reminded us of home-lavender.</p>

<p>We have been hitherto going on in a quiet, jog-trot
way enough, almost forgetting that the desert
has perils, and that we are not in a civilised land.
Now comes something to awaken us out of this
dream of comfort. A courier has arrived from Gh&acirc;t,
bringing the news that one Sidi Jafel Waled Sakertaf,<a name="page181" id="page181"></a><span class="pageno">[181]</span>
the great man of the oasis of Janet&mdash;on which
we have been speculating so pastorally&mdash;is preparing
to come out and intercept our passage to
Soudan, near the well of Tajetterat. This pleasant
intelligence came to us in a letter from Hateetah
and Jabour, who, however, philosophically
add that they are not quite sure it is correct. I
rewarded the courier with five reals, and sent him
off to Waled Shafou and the Sultan with the news;
begging the former to meet us certainly at Falezlez,
which is about four days from this, whilst Tajetterat
is nearly eight. Janet is now only a day and a-half
south-south-west from our encampment. It is a
small oasis, inhabited by Moors and Tuaricks. The
statistics of the place begin to interest us exceedingly.
We are told that there is a good deal of
corn grown there, on account of the abundance of
water. Sidi Jafel Waled Sakertaf&mdash;whose voluminous
name we found it quite easy to learn under these
circumstances&mdash;is cousin of the Sultan Shafou,
and a very old man; but we cannot hope that
in these frugal regions the gout will interfere in
our favour, and put a stop to this unprovoked foray.</p>

<p>The weather has been cool to-day. We are on
high ground, although in a wady; and this renders
the heat very supportable. The reported attack keeps
our minds occupied, and has a little upset us;
but no one talks of flinching. Besides, this has not
been the first alarm, nor will it be the last. I sent an
account of this circumstance so far to Lord Palmerston<a name="page182" id="page182"></a><span class="pageno">[182]</span>
by the courier; and should have written
much more, had not I been occupied with the news
and with the Kailouees, who have chosen this occasion
to be troublesome. We do not get so much
information, by the way, out of these people as we
might expect; they do not know the names of the
wadys and rocks hereabouts, and so pretend they
have none.</p>

<p>The hundred dollars which we brought from
Mourzuk are now nearly all gone&mdash;I have only
eight or ten left. Friend Sidi Jalef Waled Sakertaf&mdash;how
unmusical the name sounds!&mdash;will get
little money from us, and must content himself with
our baggage, if he will play the robber. For the
cousin of a Sultan, fie!</p>

<p><i>August 1.</i>&mdash;We left Ajunjer early, and made five
hours only, because to-morrow there is no herbage
until late in the evening. How tantalising to be
obliged to advance thus by short stages towards an
ambuscade! We take things pretty philosophically,
however, and make geological observations. Overweg
(who begins to show signs of weakness) is delighted
that we have at length reached a region of
granite. I think I must have passed a great number
of rocks of the same kind between Ghadamez
and Gh&acirc;t. To the eye of an ordinary observer,
some of them have the same aspect as sandstone, or
even limestone. This granite interests us, especially
as in the direct Bornou route there appears to be
none at all.<a name="page183" id="page183"></a><span class="pageno">[183]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Barth compares the Tuaricks of Gh&acirc;t and
the Haghar to lions and tigers, and the Kailouees to
snakes. The comparison well hits off their outward
characteristics, but, as Overweg says, we must not
judge of these people by the ordinary rules of
morality, or apply to them an European standard.
I suspect we shall have to put up with still more
extraordinary specimens of human nature.</p>

<p>We were proceeding, engaged in noticing the
various colours and forms of the granite, when
there appeared advancing through the ravine ahead
a number of moving figures. At first, of course, we
were a little alarmed; but it turned out to be only
a slave caravan&mdash;about twenty camels and forty
slaves. One of the little boys had an immensely large
head&mdash;quite a phenomenon. We, of course, eagerly
questioned the merchants about Sahara news, and
especially as to whether the Tuaricks had made their
appearance at Falezlez or Tajetterat. They had
neither seen nor heard of the hostile party; and
perhaps we may hope that all this is a rumour.
However, it looked very like truth; and, possibly,
Sidi Jafel may know perfectly well that there is no
occasion to hurry. The Tanelkums are now about
four days in advance of us, and may receive the first
brunt of the attack. These slave-dealers tell us,
that from Falezlez to the place where we are to
be robbed and murdered is four days of dismal
desert, without water&mdash;suffering before sacrifice.
We are getting into the heart of the Sahara at last.<a name="page184" id="page184"></a><span class="pageno">[184]</span>
Day by day the stations become more difficult.
Another caravan is to pass in a few days, which
may give us more definite intelligence. I am writing
to Government and to my wife; but of camels I
am heartily sick. Gagliuffi's camel still sticks in
my throat. It was the first to knock up. I
have left it at Gh&acirc;t&mdash;thirty-eight mahboubs gone.
People want to make a fortune out of my poor expedition.</p>

<p><i>2d.</i>&mdash;We made a long day of twelve hours, at first
between granite rocks for four hours, and then over
a sandy plain. This plain was at first scattered
with pebbles of granite, but finally it became all sand.
The granite rocks were mostly conic in form, and
on our right rose one peak at least six hundred feet
high. Further off on the same side, at a distance,
the rocks continued in a range, instead of being
scattered about like so many sugar-loaves placed
upon a plane, as mountains are represented to children.
To-day the granite became stratified, or
gneiss; there were also some fine specimens of hornblend.</p>

<p>One of our Kailouee friends amused himself on
the road by giving a good beating to his female
slave. These people transact their domestic affairs
in public with the utmost simplicity. They seem
to think they are showing themselves in a favourable
light by this brutal conduct, for I detect glances of
pride thrown towards us. Whenever these beatings
occur&mdash;which they do at no distant intervals&mdash;there<a name="page185" id="page185"></a><span class="pageno">[185]</span>
is always another servant, or some one, who
attempts to separate the enraged master from the
object of his wrath. In the present instance, interference
took place in time to prevent any very serious
consequences; otherwise, I have no doubt the ruffians
would go on exciting themselves, and beating
harder and harder, even until death ensued. We
noticed the common black bird I have already mentioned,
with white head and tail. It is indeed seen
everywhere, and may emphatically be called "The
Bird of the Desert!"</p>

<p>Next day, the 3d, we started at daybreak, and
made another long day of nearly twelve hours. It
is necessary to hurry over these inhospitable tracts.
After two hours we got among some sand-hills, and
continued all day over the same kind of ground&mdash;hill
and valley alternating, with here and there a
huge, isolated, granite, rock rising up like an island.
Pebbles strewed the surface of the sandy valleys.
I scarcely remember to have beheld so desolate
a region. For two days there has been no water,
and the camels have stretched out their necks in
vain for herbage. A little grass, it is true, was
plucked among the sand-hills to-day, and mixed
with the dates, which we are compelled to give to
the camels. These poor beasts are becoming thin
and gaunt, from the effects of heat, fatigue, and
especially from the lack of sufficient herbage.
Luckily, cool winds from the south supply the place
of the gheblee.<a name="page186" id="page186"></a><span class="pageno">[186]</span></p>

<p>This evening one of the Kailouees challenged me
to have a run with him; I accepted the challenge,
and we ran a short distance, to the great amusement
of the people.</p>

<p>Our guides are sociable companions enough.
They pointed out to day on the sand the footsteps
of the caravan which we met a few days ago going
to Gh&acirc;t; and likewise their own footsteps, left when
they passed by that way a month and a half since.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;We might have reached the well of Falezlez
last night; but as we did not know who
might be waiting for us there, preferred halting
three-quarters of an hour from it, and advanced
only in the morning, in broad daylight.</p>

<p>Here we found our dates, left by the Tanelkums
in the side of a mound of sand, with a piece of
rotten wood stuck up to mark the place. Had
they been, however, exposed by the side of the
well, and a hundred caravans had passed, no one
would have touched them. It is a point of honour
to steal nothing thus confided in the desert. Mutual<a name="page188" id="page188"></a><span class="pageno">[188]</span>
interest suggests mutual forbearance. The
Tanelkums left these dates, because we had only
hired the camels to bring them thus far, and they
knew we should not probably come up with them.
This increase of our provisions turns out to be
opportune. Without it, some of our animals might
have fallen down.</p>

<p>Round and near Gh&acirc;t we found the stones
which are set up at certain intervals to mark the
direction of the roads, frequently arranged in circular
heaps. An usual form is pyramidal, but the
most common practice of all is to set up one stone
end-ways upon one or two others. Sometimes a
hundred of these will be seen together.</p>

<p>We have had some trouble in satisfying the
Kailouees for the protection they afford us. At
Gh&acirc;t the agreement made was for one hundred
reals, half in goods and half in money, and a trifling
present when they arrived at their journey's end.
This was arranged by Haj Ibrahim and Mohammed
Kafa, a merchant of Gh&acirc;t, and consul or
wakeel of the Kailouees, whom I have before mentioned.
Immediately that they became a little
familiar with us, they began to say that they had
not received all the hundred reals; but on hearing
that we should write to Gh&acirc;t about it, they dropped
this plea, and asked for another hundred reals as
the present promised them, as they pretended,
through Haj Ibrahim. When the news came respecting
Sidi Jafel&mdash;taking advantage of our supposed<a name="page189" id="page189"></a><span class="pageno">[189]</span>
fears&mdash;they boldly demanded a sword, some
burnouses, and one hundred reals in money.</p>

<p>All these demands I firmly resisted as long as
I could; but at length, when a compromise seemed
necessary, we arranged for a hundred reals more
in goods. A part we have given here, and the
rest we have promised on our arrival at Aheer.
Nothing is now said of Zinder, although the first
arrangement was from Aheer to Zinder. Such are
the people we have to deal with in Africa. But
could we not find similar extortion amongst the
innkeepers and the conductors of carriages on the
highways of Europe?</p>

<p>That all the people are <i>soua soua</i>&mdash;"higgledy-piggledy"
is our only equivalent phrase&mdash;is bad news
for a Saharan traveller; for it signifies nothing less
than that there is no paramount authority in a
country, and that the traveller is exposed to the
insolence of every evil-disposed person. Such is
represented to be the condition of Tidek, the first
province of Aheer upon which we shall enter.</p>

<p>The scarcity of food in Aheer&mdash;one of the
causes of the disturbances that are taking place&mdash;arises,
we are told, from the quantity of provisions
carried away from the country when the Kailouees
made their expedition against the Walad Suleiman.
But this expedition is now finished, and there
has been time for a revival of prosperity. Sickness
and disease are reported in Aheer at the present
time. These are unpleasant tidings for a<a name="page190" id="page190"></a><span class="pageno">[190]</span>
traveller who is braving the fatigues and perils of
the Great Sahara, in hopes of some little repose at
his journey's end.</p>

<p>To express great numbers, the Arabs and Tuaricks
always use the similitudes, "like the dust,"
or "like flies." When the Tuaricks say we are to
give nothing to anybody&mdash;speaking, of course, of
other people, as Hateetah to me&mdash;they take up a
little sand between the ends of their fingers and
scatter it on the palms of their hands. When they
wish to describe roads free from hills and ravines
they extend the palm of their hands, adding, "Like
this." I cannot say that I admire the Kailouees
in any respect. Barth's comparison to snakes is
tolerably correct. They have duped us in various
ways, and our only consolation is being able to
report their conduct to their friends in Gh&acirc;t and
Zinder.</p>

<p>These observations occur to me during our prolonged
halt at the well of Falezlez. The whole
caravan needs this refreshment, both on account of
the fatigues it has already encountered, as of those
to which it may look forward on the tract of desert
which now stretches wild and inhospitable before
us. Yesterday the sky was completely overcast;
but during the night and this morning the clouds
have been succeeded by wind, and strong blasts have
completely cooled us. I do not think that the climate
would affect me so much as it does if I had something
good to eat; but the Tanelkums have got<a name="page191" id="page191"></a><span class="pageno">[191]</span>
with them all my soups. The Germans eat hausa
like Tuaricks, and do very well. I expected to
find the water of Falezlez most unpalatable. This,
indeed, is its reputation; but we were all agreeably
deceived, and the salt taste was scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>About ten in the morning, on the 5th, a solitary
white camel, with a rider, was reported as trotting
rapidly over the hills to the east. The circumstance
created some excitement. It was Mohammed
Wataitee, son of Shafou, coming riding like
the monarch of the desert, as he is, upon his fine
maharee. He had been travelling three days and
three nights consecutively; and however eager we
were to hear his opinion of the dangers that threatened
us, it was necessary to allow him to spend the
whole day in repose.</p>

<p>When we could get speech of the traveller, he
talked boastfully of the value of his protection,
and assured us that we had really nothing to fear.
He had heard, or would acknowledge to have
heard, no rumours of the hostile intentions of his
father's cousin; only, he observed, "He is an old
man," with a gesture that implied wilfulness. He
would have us believe that this terrible enemy who
has been pursuing us&mdash;at least in our imagination&mdash;is
nothing but a testy old gentleman, who says
these sort of things in a fanciful way just to express
his power.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;We were off soon after sunrise, and made
a long day of twelve hours. The Kailouees were<a name="page192" id="page192"></a><span class="pageno">[192]</span>
half an hour more performing the same distance.
They started first, and we travel a little faster than
they. Scarcely a blade of herbage cheered our
sight to day. A sandy, gravelly hamadah, with
a few rocks and sand-hills here and there,&mdash;such is
the nature of the country. The rocks now assume
a conic form, <i>ke ras suker</i>, like a sugar-loaf, as the
people say. Our course was south-west, and so it
will continue to be, nearly as far as Esalan, I was
amused by an observation of Dr. Overweg; he said,
"I now understand the system of these people"
(Saharan travellers). "It is to travel as much as
possible without labour&mdash;to do all that is necessary,
but nothing more. When we left Tripoli, instead
of reposing immediately at the camping-ground of
the caravan, everybody was running about to climb
the hills and rocks; but now we all fall down to
rest as soon as we have halted." The Doctor speaks
of himself and Barth, certainly not of me; for I
always rested as much as possible with the people.</p>

<p>My old broken white umbrella attracts some
attention amongst the Kailouees. They all make a
trial of it. Strong umbrellas would be very useful
during the hot summer months for all Saharan
travellers.</p>

<p>I to-day asked the son of Shafou how his father
liked the sword. An unfortunate question. He
replied, "Ah, he sends his compliments; but says
the sword is a little thing, and that you ought to
have sent him some money. There were many<a name="page193" id="page193"></a><span class="pageno">[193]</span>
people waiting to see you at Aroukeen. They
were much disappointed at your not coming. They
said,&mdash;'The Christians must pass this way.'" It
appears that a whole tribe of Tuaricks were waiting
for us, to beg, and to "eat us up," as the Arabs
graphically express it. In this respect we have
been fortunate in not finding Tuaricks on our line
of route.</p>

<p>7th&mdash;We made another long and weary day
of twelve hours. The fatigue is killing. Our
course was south-west, through heaps and groups
of rocks and narrow shallow wadys. In some
directions, ridges of small rocks; in others, isolated
masses of conic form. The bed of the desert is
mostly granite, and some of the rocks are of the
same substance. Indeed, the Central Sahara seems
to bristle with ridges of granite. Then there are
many varieties of this stone, and others springing
out of granite, as quartz rocks and felspar, and
some sandstone mixed with quartz. Across our
path we observed many traces of wild oxen, and a
few were seen with their immense horns. Birds and
reptiles were rare, and the lizard not so frequent
as before. Our camels found scarcely a mouthful
of hasheesh; no trees were visible, except a few
miserable tholukhs.</p>

<p>The Kailouees have changed in a marked manner
since Wataitee has rejoined us, and are much
more civil. But I do not talk to them, contenting
myself with a civil "Good day. How do you do?"<a name="page194" id="page194"></a><span class="pageno">[194]</span>
This prevents them from begging of me. They
beg of Barth and Overweg, who do not notice
them. As I am "the person who gives," I am
obliged to be very polite, but distant.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;We started at sunrise, and made a short
day of seven hours and a-half, resting at last in a
wady surrounded with rocks, where there was some
good herbage.</p>

<p>In the course of this march we met another
portion of the large Soudan caravan, and consigned
to it our letters. They brought the news that
the Tanelkums were a day only in advance, having
halted to take up water at Aroukeen, where they
dug again the old well which had been blocked
with stones.</p>

<p>This caravan informed us, besides, that the
body of the large caravan was resting at the well
of Tajetterat. They had seen no Tuaricks. We
begin to hope that we have been disturbed by
false alarms.</p>

<p>At about four hours from the encampment of
yesterday we descried some mountains to the south-west.
Near them is the well of Janet, said to be
about seven hours out of the line of route. It is
a frequent resort of Tuaricks, who come to the
neighbourhood for hunting purposes. All this region
is favourable to sport. Along our route to-day
were noticed footmarks of wild oxen and wadan.</p>

<p>Wataitee asked me whether he should go to
see if there were any Tuaricks at Janet, to get<a name="page195" id="page195"></a><span class="pageno">[195]</span>
news of them; but I told him that he had better
continue with us until we reach Tajetterat. This
he has agreed to do; and we all feel that his presence
is, to a certain extent, a protection.</p>

<p>In the evening we had a visit from three
Tuarick sportsmen, with a couple of dogs. We
purchased two carcases of wadan from them. It
would have been most amusing to an untravelled
European to witness the bartering between us.
The principal hunter got hold of the grey calico,
and would not let go until he had his full measure.
Then how deliberately he measured again with his
long arms, with all the appearance of justice,
whilst he was filching off inches at once! Two
small carcases cost us about a mahboub. Wataitee
pretends that these hunters never carry provisions
with them, but must catch wadan and oxen or die.
I made a tremendous supper of wadan, being as
ravenous as a wolf for a little meat and soup. The
meat is so strong and nourishing, that it threatened
to produce injurious effects. It is necessary to be
cautious about indulging in unaccustomed food.
Still this meat is far superior to camels' flesh.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;We rose, and, with our accustomed regularity,
started before daybreak in search of water,
for the Kailouees are without this element essential
to life in the desert. Having continued about six
hours and a-half, we encamped in Wady Aroukeen.
It would not have been necessary to come to this
place, had our imprudent Kailouees taken in a sufficient<a name="page196" id="page196"></a><span class="pageno">[196]</span>
supply of water. This wady lies east and
Tajetterat west.</p>

<p>Our course had been over an elevated rocky
plain; but I had no idea of the height to which we
had arrived. Suddenly the ground broke up on
either side of the track into rocky eminences, and
we now came to the brow of a sharp descent. The
valley of Aroukeen wound as it were like a snake
far down at the bottom of an immense hollow, surrounded
on all sides by an amphitheatre of savage-looking
mountains&mdash;great stony swells, made hideous
here and there by crags and ravines, and piled away
on all sides in shattered magnificence. This is the
grandest desert prospect I have yet seen, and must
strongly clash with the ordinary notion of the Great
Sahara which untravelled geologists have represented
as the recently-elevated bed of some ocean.
We must now have reached the summit of an inland
Atlas, dividing the extreme limits of the Gh&acirc;t
territory from the, to us, mysterious kingdom of
Aheer.</p>

<p>In Wady Aroukeen there are some of the
finest tholukhs I have seen, reaching the height of
thirty or forty feet. There are, besides, two new
species of trees, the adwa of Soudan, called, in Aheer,
<i>aborah</i>: they have not been observed before, and are
natives of Bornou. Their general aspect resembles
the tholukh, but they have large prickles and a
smooth roundish leaf. There is a good deal of
hasheesh in this valley.<a name="page197" id="page197"></a><span class="pageno">[197]</span></p>

<p>We are now, they say, about twelve days from
Aheer, exclusive of the stoppages; twelve days, I
mean, of twelve hours a-piece. These long stretches
are desperately fatiguing, and trying to the health;
but there is no remedy. We must make these
weary stages on account of the scarcity of water and
herbage for the camels. The Kailouees tie their
camels by the lower jaw, and fasten the string to the
baggage piled on the back of the preceding animal;
and the long line moves on well this way. The
Tuaricks fasten their bridles, when they ride their
maharees, by a round ring in the nose.</p>

<p>We had granite again to-day, and fine beds of
felspar, pebbles, and rocks. The geology of this
portion of Sahara is very interesting, but no crystals
have yet been found. Yesterday and to-day,
the wind has been high, moderating greatly the
heat. The wind is nearly always south-east. The
nights are resplendent. Jupiter and Venus are
seen close together in beautiful conjunction. The
constellation of the Scorpion rises higher in the
south, whilst the Pole-star apparently falls.</p>

<p>I read nothing nowadays but a few verses of
the Greek Testament, and write these miserable
leaves of journal. I must save my strength. I am
very weak as it is. We have still got nearly forty
days of actual travelling to make before we enter
Soudan, but we hope Providence will allow us a
little rest at Aheer.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;We moved on late this morning up Wady<a name="page198" id="page198"></a><span class="pageno">[198]</span>
Aroukeen, one hour and a-half, to a place where
we have better feeding for the camels; but it was
scarcely worth the trouble of loading and unloading,
as the animals could have been led up here to this
portion of the wady.</p>

<p>Wady Aroukeen is in every respect a desirable
place for the resting-place of a caravan. It is full
of trees and hasheesh, and lined with lofty precipitous
rocks, which afford shelter in winter and in
summer, and, as say the Scriptures, give "the shadow
of a great rock in a weary land." The well
dug by the Tanelkums supplies very palatable
water. It lies about an hour and a-half from our
encampment.</p>

<p>I sent off my Soudanese servant this morning to
the Tanelkums, to ask them to wait for us; or at
least leave the things behind which I require for our
use.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening the new moon (second evening)
was seen by our people, telling them that the
Ramadhan was finished. They saluted the pale
crescent horn with some discharges of their guns.</p>

<p>To-day is a great feast, but they have not the
means of keeping it.</p>

<p>I cannot say that at this portion of my journey
my mind is visited by much cheerfulness. However
agreeable may be the valley of Aroukeen, with
its grass patches, its clumps of trees, and the eternal
shadow of its rocks, I find my strength begin,
to a certain extent, to fail me. For several days I<a name="page199" id="page199"></a><span class="pageno">[199]</span>
have had some threatening symptoms of ill-health;
not very serious, perhaps, to a person surrounded
with any of the comforts of civilisation, but much so
to one in my position. Besides, despite my endeavours
to disbelieve the dangers with which we
are said to be menaced from lawless freebooters, it is
difficult to disregard them so far as to remain perfectly
impassive.</p>

<p>My Kailouee friends do not seem to share our
apprehensions. Sometimes this circumstance cheers
me; at others it suggests the idea that they may be
in league with their brethren. Let us hope not.
At any rate I am still displeased with them on account
of their shabby conduct, and disposed, perhaps,
to look at them more unfavourably than they
deserve.</p>

<p>A man came over the hills to our right in the
course of the day. He belonged to the Soudan
caravan, the great body of which was passing at no
great distance by another road. Our presence does
not seem to be agreeable to such of these people
as derive no profit from it. This individual,
in his own name and that of his companions, insists
that we Christians must not be allowed to enter the
City of Marabouts, the Holy City of Aheer. Many
Musulman countries of the interior have their holy
cities. Perhaps this worthy man made these observations
because he had nothing else to say. At any
rate, having expressed his opinion, he went off.
I regretted his churlish warning; but his presence,<a name="page200" id="page200"></a><span class="pageno">[200]</span>
to a certain extent, cheered me. It was pleasant to
know that a large body of my fellow-creatures
were near at hand in this inhospitable desert, even
though they entertained feelings of suspicion against
us, and were proceeding on a path which might
never again bring us together. Caravans often pass
thus in these regions, like ships at sea, which hail
each other if within hearing, but, not lying-to, are
satisfied by this slight testimony of mutual sympathy.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i>&mdash;We started somewhat late, and made a
good day of nine hours and a-half through winding
narrow valleys, supplying a fair quantity of hasheesh.
The country around was wild and rugged&mdash;still
the same primitive formation, gneiss being the
most common rock. On the way we heard the
story of the origin of the Kailouees, as given by the
Haghar Tuaricks; it is probably meant as a satire.
According to this people, a female slave escaped from
their country, and travelling over the desert, reached
her native place in Soudan. But she bore within
her bosom a pledge that still half bound her to her
ancient masters. She brought forth a male child,
and loved him and reared him; so that in process
of time he took a wife, and from this union sprung
the bastard race of Kailouees.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>&mdash;We had halted the previous evening because
we were within an hour of the well of Tajetterat,
which had become famous in our caravan as
the place where we were to be attacked and despoiled<a name="page201" id="page201"></a><span class="pageno">[201]</span>
by the freebooter Sidi Jafel Waled Sakertaf.
This morning we pursued our way, cautiously sending
scouts before. But as the wady opened, the place
proved to be desolate, and we advanced joyously,
with the confidence that this time at least we had
been disturbed by a false alarm. Still, as we descended
towards the well we could not now and
then refrain from casting our glances about into the
gorges of the mountains, to discover whether or not,
after all, our enemies were lying in ambush there.
Not a living thing stirred upon the hills; and we
gathered round the two wells, or rather holes scraped
out of the sand, with feelings of delight and confidence.
The water proved to be good; it is said to be
produced by rain, and to be purgative,&mdash;a quality
it must derive from the soil through which it trickles.
We determined, however, not to stop at this
place, lest the men of Janet<a name="anchor7" id="anchor7"></a><a href="#footnote7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> might after all arrive;
and pushing on, in hopes that our track
might be confounded with those of the caravans, we
reached, after a rapid march of five hours and a-half,
the well of Esalan. As we approached, we saw an
encampment in its neighbourhood, and camels grazing
about. Our vanguard halted; and the whole
caravan soon became massed in the entrance of the<a name="page202" id="page202"></a><span class="pageno">[202]</span>
gorge through which we were about to issue. Our
far-sighted guards, however, soon discovered that
there was no cause for alarm. We had at length
overtaken our Tanelkum friends; and riding forward
I greeted them, and, forgetting all idea of
danger, anxiously asked for our baggage, and above
all for my inestimable supply of potted soups!</p>

<p>In this part of the country the scenery is far
more open than it was before; the mountains are
lower, but the wadys are not so wide. Here and
there occurred considerable patches of herbage,
called <i>sabot</i>, and many large, fine trees. Amongst
the smaller ones, for the first time, we came upon the
senna plant, some of the leaves of which our people
plucked. Higher up, in Aheer, is apparently the
native soil of this plant. We had also again the
adwa, several trees, and the kaiou or kremka, the
only plant we have yet seen with a truly tropical
aspect.</p>

<p>The adwa bears a fruit something like the date,
and is eaten by the people in Soudan. As to the
<i>sabot</i>, above mentioned, it is a kind of herbage,
which covers the beds of the valleys in this region
of primitive rock: it forms the principal food of
our camels. The <i>bou rekabah</i>, however, the best
for them, is in small quantities, but when seen is
devoured to the sand. The people of Aheer eat its
seed as ghaseb.</p>

<p>Yesterday, we saw, for the first time, a bird's nest
in the desert, in the side of a rock. It contained no<a name="page203" id="page203"></a><span class="pageno">[203]</span>
eggs; our people, on a former occasion, brought in
some. It is astonishing how few birds' nests are
found, though in some places a good number of small
flutterers are seen. About the wells of Tajetterat
darted half-a-dozen quails. We have not yet
observed an ostrich, although many traces have
been found on the sand. Around, however, are
numbers of the wadan,<a name="anchor8" id="anchor8"></a><a href="#footnote8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and our huntsmen are
active. Yesterday some flesh of this animal was
brought in.</p>

<p>In this part of the route we frequently fell in
with small heaps of stones; and if we ask what they
mean, are invariably told they are the graves of
slave-children who have perished by the way, most
probably in the arms of their mothers. What wonderful
tales of sorrow and anguish could these rocks
give, if they were not compelled to eternal dumbness!
What sighs, what shrieks of grief have echoed
here! How many tears have watered this track!
These thoughts saddened our way; but they seemed
at the same time to rouse that enthusiasm which is
the only adequate ally to those engaged in such a
mission as ours.</p>

<p>The son of Shafou is to leave us at Esalan. I
may as well record here, in form, a list of our grievances<a name="page204" id="page204"></a><span class="pageno">[204]</span>
against the Tuaricks, for the information and
warning of future travellers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1st. They, the Tuaricks, wished to obtain presents
from the Germans, nearly in the same quantity
as from myself; or, at least, something considerable.</p>

<p>2d. They wanted us to remain six weeks in Gh&acirc;t,
to wait for an answer from Sultan En-Noor at
Aheer.</p>

<p>3d. They refused to conduct us to the frontier of
Aheer, according to their agreement at Mourzuk.</p>

<p>4th. They demanded seventy reals for the passage
of our free blacks.</p>

<p>5th. They insisted on having the presents for
Berka, Khanouhen, and Jabour, before the treaty
was signed.</p>
</div>

<p>The first two demands I successfully resisted, as
also the third at Gh&acirc;t. The fourth was compromised;
we paid twenty-eight reals instead of seventy.
The last I yielded, on the condition that I should
only give three burnouses.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;The water of Esalan is, likewise, nothing
but a deposit of rain. Several holes are scooped out
in the sand, down to the rocky bed of the valley.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="footnote7" id="footnote7"></a><a href="#anchor7">[7]</a> This name is sometimes written "Janet," sometimes "Ghanet"
by Mr. Richardson, who, moreover, now describes the inhabitants of
the place as Haghar and then as Azgher. A more definite account is
given further on. It appears, however, that vulgarly in the Sahara all
the Tuaricks are called Haghar or Hagar, which seems to have been
used rather indiscriminately in the caravan as a term of fear.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="footnote8" id="footnote8"></a><a href="#anchor8">[8]</a> Wadan is the Arabic name of the aoudad of the Berbers. We
call the animal "mouflon" (<i>Ovis tragelaphus</i>). It is found in considerable
numbers throughout the deserts of Northern Africa, from the
Atlantic to the Red Sea. I have seen a beautiful specimen, nearly all
milk-white, in Cairo.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p>We have at length heard what appears to be a fair
account of the rumour respecting that terrible Sidi
Jafel. He did leave Janet as if bound for Tajetterat;
but it was for the purpose of giving his camels a
feeding of herbage in that direction. He took his
family and tents with him, and has been seen with
his son by the huntsman of Wady Aroukeen. He is
not a sheikh, but a spirited old man; and, from what
I can understand, is a Haghar belonging to Ghemama,
and not an Azgher of Gh&acirc;t. They now
assure us that he had never any intention of attacking<a name="page206" id="page206"></a><span class="pageno">[206]</span>
us; but as there is rarely smoke without a fire, it
is possible he may have indulged in a little threatening
talk, just to impress an idea of his importance
on the people of Janet. This is Waled Shafou's
view of the case.</p>

<p>We moved on from the well of Esalan in the
evening, but only for an hour and a half, to a place
in the same wady; where there was abundant herbage
for the camels. Here we had another Tuarick
dispute. Wataitee pretended to fix at a very high
rate his services in answering to our call, and proceeding
with us as far as this well. At first I refused
to give anything at all, since he had stipulated
to conduct us as far as the frontiers of Aheer. I
then offered him a burnouse (a small white one),
and a shasheeah (or fez), both which he obstinately
rejected in my teeth, but did not state what he
wanted&mdash;except muttering, "Money, money,
money!"</p>

<p>Fearing some violence from his threatening
manner, I was obliged to load my guns and pistols.
Whilst declaring he would not take anything by
force, he used very threatening language. He was
to have left us at the well, but followed us this
evening; and when we decamped I determined,
therefore, if possible, to come to some arrangement
with him through En-Noor, as he might prove a
dangerous enemy.</p>

<p>Whilst speaking to Yusuf on this subject, En-Noor
the Kailouee, who, by the bye, must not be<a name="page207" id="page207"></a><span class="pageno">[207]</span>
confounded with the Sultan of Aheer bearing the
same name, came in and told us that he had just
seen Wataitee, who was exceedingly exasperated,
and who threatened to stop the caravan in the
morning if his demands were not complied with.
What is to be done? Were we to aim at satisfying
all the unjust claims made upon us, we should not
only be beggared immediately, but should have
whole crowds of fresh suppliants coming in every
day. Wataitee seems to expect that I should give
him something like a hundred reals in money for
his pretended extra services, and goes thundering
about, "that the lands, and rocks, and mountains
of Gh&acirc;t do not belong to God, but to the Azgher,
to whom the Creator has given them once and for
ever, and who are the sovereign and omnipotent
rulers of this portion of earth&mdash;this large tract of
Sahara." There has often been detected in the
speeches of African princes a certain degree of blasphemy
and resistance to the omnipotent sovereignty
of the Deity they adore; and this kind of language
was not new to me. The possessors of lawless
power seem easily to identify themselves with gods.</p>

<p>To us, naked rocks, and treeless valleys, and bare
stony plains, are objects without interest, except in
a geological point of view. But it is very different
with the Haghar and Azgher. In their eyes, a
plain of stones and sand holds the place of a heath
of growing bloom; a barren valley is a vale of
fertility; rocks and mountains are always objects of<a name="page208" id="page208"></a><span class="pageno">[208]</span>
beauty; whilst wells are treasured of wealth, as
indeed they are verily in the desert. A Tuarick
may be said to know every stone of his arid
kingdom.</p>

<p>Taking these things into consideration, and
making a merit of necessity, we agreed together to
offer him thirty reals. He had already come down
to fifty, and now accepted the thirty, but said they
must be the large ones, or <i>douros</i> (dollars). It was
arranged that I should pay the money to En-Noor in
Aheer; for all now had become convinced that not
one of us three had any dollars worth speaking of
left. I believe I have some six or seven, whilst the
Germans have none. If we had brought a thousand
with us, they would all have been scattered to the
wind in these Tuarick countries. Our servants,
being persuaded that we have no dollars left, have
sworn to the fact; so that my candid declaration,
"That if they were to kill me, they could not find
ten dollars to pay them for their trouble," is now
believed.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;Wataitee came early to my tent, and asked
me for a bit of sugar. I gave him half a loaf, with
which he was apparently well satisfied; for afterwards
he asked if I had any letters to take to Gh&acirc;t.
I consigned to him a letter for Mr. Bidwell and my
wife. Wataitee amused Barth by recounting to
him numerous dues which he had failed to pay.
Amongst the rest, a tax to see the Kasar Janoon;
fifty dollars for drinking of the well of Esalan, &amp;c.<a name="page209" id="page209"></a><span class="pageno">[209]</span>
&amp;c. These matters being at length settled, we proceeded
for Aisou, and journeyed a long day of
twelve hours and a-half. I was looking out every
moment, expecting to clear the rocks, and enter
upon the immeasurable stretch of plain reported to
us. But all was a rocky granite expanse, with
conical-shaped rocks, exactly as before described.
We begin to tire of this kind of country, which
seemed so picturesque when we first entered upon it.</p>

<p>To-day the weather was misty, and we felt
as if entering into the circle of a new climate.
Few or no animals were seen. All is dismal and
dreary.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;We rose at daybreak, and proceeded steadily
on, making a day's journey of thirteen long
weary hours. The stony plain opened rather more
than yesterday, but there were always rocks on
either hand.</p>

<p>To-day we had the first drops of Soudan rain,
and a complete Soudan atmosphere. We also observed
the vermilion tinge on the clouds, peculiar
to Central Africa; and the air was hot and clammy.
Every sort of desert phenomenon is seen in these
parts in perfection. The mirage often fills up the
interstices left between the rocks, and inundates the
plain ahead with its fantastic waters.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;We were early in motion this day; and
started, cheered by the hope held out to us, that at
the termination of two long marches we should at
length reach, at the Seven Wells of Aisou, the<a name="page210" id="page210"></a><span class="pageno">[210]</span>
frontiers of Aheer. It is true that we were promised
no town, no village, not even visible landmarks;
above all, no custom-house officers to suggest
the blessings of civilisation. There was, in truth,
some idea that very indefinite dues might be exacted
of us during our progress through the northern districts
of the Asben territory. Still it was a comfort
to get at last within the limits of the influence of
a form of polity, however rude.</p>

<p>Whilst we were indulging in these reflections,
there came on a regular desert-storm. A vault
of clouds, like huge irregular rocks, was soon
heaped up overhead. The thunder roared from
side to side of the horizon. The lightning flashed,
sometimes above, sometimes between, the isolated
hills, showing them like long black tents pitched
here and there on the plain. Our beasts moved
eagerly on; and their drivers, though accustomed
to such phenomena, were hushed into awe. The
tempest did not last many minutes; but it was
accompanied by wind so violent that we could
scarcely preserve our seats in the saddles, and
finished off with so violent a shower of rain that we
got quite wet through almost in an instant. This
is a fair warning that we are really within the
tropics.</p>

<p>We made fourteen hours that day, and felt
dreadfully exhausted on arriving at the place where
we expected to encamp for the night. In two
hours, however, the Kailouees came and told us that<a name="page211" id="page211"></a><span class="pageno">[211]</span>
there was no more water in the skins; that the
camels were restless, knowing that a well was ahead;
and that it was better to move on at once,
and make for the well of Aisou, that marks the
commencement of the Aheer territory. We started,
therefore, again, although I was suffering from illness,
and moved on all night, nodding in our
saddles in a half-slumber, that to those unaccustomed
is almost more fatiguing than watchfulness.
Several times I felt inclined to insist on a halt; but
the people, who were eager to arrive, cried out that
<i>the camels wanted to reach the water</i>; and proceeding
accordingly, about seven o'clock the next morning
we at length reached the Seven Wells. We found
only two open, the others being closed up by
sand. Some of them belong to the Kailouees, and
the others to the Tuaricks of Gh&acirc;t. There is no
good feeding for the camels, only a few tufts of
coarse herbage. The kingdom of Aheer presents
itself under grim colours. I did not move about
this day, but consecrated it to rest. The rocks of
Asben rise above the horizon.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;Bidding adieu to the land of Gh&acirc;t&mdash;if that
name can be applied to the desert which we have just
traversed&mdash;we left the Seven Wells, and once more
entered upon the desert. We had scarcely been in
motion two hours, when there was an alarm of
Haghar coming upon us from behind. I did
not at first know how the report originated, and
looked anxiously around upon the desert expecting<a name="page212" id="page212"></a><span class="pageno">[212]</span>
to see a body of enemies charging down some valley.
All the people ran for their guns, and I hastily delivered
out powder and ball. It was amusing to see
the slaves with their bows and arrows, coming forward
and trying to look martial. I have no doubt
they would have done their best. When the tumult
was a little calmed, I learned that two of our people,
who had remained behind a short time at the
wells of Aisou, saw a Tuarick coming up to the
place, and, two others slowly following, all three
mounted on tall maharees. They spoke to the
one who arrived first, and inquired if many were
behind. To this they received a laconic answer,
"Yes." One of them accordingly, feigning to
retire, left his servant hid behind a rock to watch
what took place, and ran after us to communicate
the unwelcome intelligence, that we might expect
an attack. We marched the whole day with our
weapons in hand, keeping a sharp look-out in the
rear. Of course there was no other subject of conversation
than the robbers, of whose existence our
fears made us certain. Were they, after all, led
by that Sidi Jafel, of whom rumour had lately
become so complimentary? Whence did these
encouraging accounts come? Were they circulated
by persons interested in putting us off our
guard? Discussing these questions, we pushed on
through a very arid country, searching for one of
those two blessings, which seem to be always
separated in this part of the desert,&mdash;water and<a name="page213" id="page213"></a><span class="pageno">[213]</span>
herbage. We had found the former at Aisou; the
latter greeted us in plenty at a place called Takeesat,
where we encamped, intending to pass the night and
the whole of next day. The herbage was of the
kind called <i>nasee</i>, which is very strengthening for
the camels.</p>

<p>I believed that the Haghar would not follow the
Kailouees upon their own territory, but I was mistaken.
Just before sunset, to our surprise, we saw
rising above the hills around the valley where we
are encamped, three mounted men. These mysterious
Haghar are then determined, we thought,
to pursue us Christians as their natural prey! The
men rode coolly up and mingled with us, probably understanding
and enjoying the looks of suspicion and
terror that greeted them. No one thought proper,
at first, to address them a single question; and they
were allowed to picket their maharees without molestation.
It must be confessed that there was no little
agitation in our camp, and everything was done to
give any attacking force a warm reception. We
made barricades of the boat, and kept watch all
night. We also scoured the valley all round to see
if there were any other people about.</p>

<p>I must insist, for the credit of our gallantry,
that it was not of these three men that we were afraid.
Our caravan was composed of sixty individuals
capable of bearing arms, besides women and children.
Our camels also amounted to one hundred
and seven. Had we not, therefore, been tormented<a name="page214" id="page214"></a><span class="pageno">[214]</span>
for so many days by rumours of intended attacks, we
should have laughed at these Haghars, however
fierce might have been their looks, and however
hostile their intentions. But our guides, who knew
the habits of the desert, did not think it beneath
their dignity to be alarmed, nor to look anxiously
about to the right and to the left, as if every stone
concealed an enemy, every ravine an ambush.</p>

<p>By the way, it may be as well to mention here,
that the reader may know how to call the enemies
we feared, that although vulgarly the whole race
that inhabits between the borders of Fezzan and
Timbuctoo are called Haghar, the Tuaricks of Gh&acirc;t
are properly distinguished as Azgher; and those
located towards Tuat and the Joliba, Haghar. Had
they and their party been of generally predatory dispositions,
they would have had something to occupy
them&mdash;the caravan belonging to Haj Ibrahim coming
from Soudan. We should, perhaps, be uncharitable
enough to hope that precious time might be occupied
in plundering these good people, were we
not certain that, if we are really to be attacked, it is
because of the presence of Christians. Will our
guides peril life or limb to preserve from danger
people whose tenets they abhor?</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;The three men, supposed scouts or spies,
remained with us during the night. At first, it was
proposed to push on, and get as far as possible away
from danger; but as our unbidden guests made a great
oath that they did not know that there were foreigners<a name="page215" id="page215"></a><span class="pageno">[215]</span>
in the caravan, and that they only wanted a supper,
having had nothing to eat for fifteen days, we
determined to carry out our original intention, both
for the sake of our camels and ourselves. That the
men might he bound to us by the tie of hospitality, I
presented them with some hamsa, to which En-Noor
added a little zumeetah, and we determined at all
hazards to give our camels and ourselves rest. Our
people, in fact, soon discovered that the Tuaricks
had brought nothing with them but a single skin of
water. They pretend they are going to see their
friends and relations in Aheer, and wish to accompany
us, which our people have politely declined.
But I must see the end of them before I set down
an opinion.</p>

<p>I wrote up my journal to-day, and am in good
health. My spirits are a little soured, nay, exasperated
into activity by these constant troubles.
It is very hot now. I have hit upon a happy contrivance
for keeping out the sun from my tent. I
lay my carpet on the sandy floor of my tent, and
with my table and the frame of my bed I make a
wooden covering over. On the top I place my
mattress and thick blankets, I then lay myself
down underneath; and am perfectly protected from
the sun above, whilst the cool breeze enters at the
bottom of the tent. There is, then, not a person in
the caravan who suffers so little from the heat as I
do, I recommend the plan to travellers.</p>

<p>These last four days we have made immense<a name="page216" id="page216"></a><span class="pageno">[216]</span>
progress towards Aheer&mdash;I mean, its inhabited districts.</p>

<table cellpadding="2" summary="Progress towards Aheer">
<tr><td>Wednesday</td> <td>12 &frac12;</td> <td>hours</td> <td></td> <td>31</td> <td align="center">miles.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Sometimes, however, the camels went at least
three miles an hour. We have come, indeed, about
130 miles, and nearly all south; which has brought
us so much more within the influence of the climate
of Soudan. On the third day, at noon, the granite
region disappeared, and we have now sandstone
again.</p>

<p>Some of our servants have begun to feel uneasy,
and are becoming troublesome, in consequence of
these constant alarms of Haghar. To do the free
blacks justice, they behave well. Yusuf is getting
out of temper, and somewhat changed in manner.
He is annoyed at seeing me not place so much confidence
in him as at first; I have reason to be
dissatisfied with his carelessness. Mahommed of
Tunis is a good servant, but at times impertinent.</p>

<p>I am getting rather more accustomed to our
Kailouee companions. They are dressed in most
respects like the Tuaricks, but seem to take pride
in loading themselves with a luxury of weapons.
To see one of them running after a camel is really
a ludicrous sight: bow, arrows, sword, gun, pistols,<a name="page217" id="page217"></a><span class="pageno">[217]</span>
dagger, stick out in all directions, and it is hard to
imagine how they would behave in the midst of this
arsenal if attacked. The chief of them is En-Noor,
a person of mild and good manners&mdash;quite a gentleman,
in fact. He is a man of light complexion; but
his two companions are dark as thorough negroes.
These individuals, Dedee and Feraghe by name, are
great beggars, and by no means scrupulous in
their conduct. I steadily resist their demands.
En-Noor manages to preserve his dignity by their
side. He tells me he will go along with us as far as
Zinder. The Kailouees have some servants with
them, very good-humoured black fellows. Of the
Tanelkums I know little; but Haj Omer, who will
accompany us to Kanou, seems a man of courage
and tact. There are two or three venerable old
men amongst these Tuaricks, together with some
young ones. They all feel the civilising effect of
visiting Mourzuk. Certainly this people could do
much, if they pleased, for the civilisation of Africa;
but at present they are actively engaged in drawing
out of the unfortunate central countries the capital
requisite to maintain even their existence. Of
Boro, the sheikh of Aghadez, I cannot yet venture
an opinion. They say, he spoke sharply against
Hateetah and Wataitee.</p>

<p>To return to the Kailouees. I imagine they
must resemble all the men we shall find in the
interior, in one respect&mdash;the love of women. They
are eloquent in describing the beauties of the cities<a name="page218" id="page218"></a><span class="pageno">[218]</span>
of Soudan&mdash;eloquent, I mean, in their sensual style,
of which I cannot venture to give a specimen. The
Tanelkums, children of the desert, are, like the
Haghars, far less sensual in their imaginations, and
indulge less in amorous conversation. There are
some comely women-slaves in the caravan, but
most of them are very plain. They have in general
negro features, but a few are light in complexion.
Their clothing is poor, without any attempt at
finery; but when they have prepared the food of
their masters they take their shares freely. They
walk well on the road when necessary, and being
light and slightly made, do not appear to suffer
from fatigue.</p>

<p>As a rule, all these women are modest and
decorous in behaviour, and are treated with considerable
respect. No master interferes with the
slaves of another, and most of them are permitted
in their turn to ride. A poor creature belonging to
a Tuatee, however, is forced always to trudge on
foot, although its master often takes a lift himself.
Two of the women have infants in their arms&mdash;little
things, as knowing, to all appearance, as those that
can run. These mothers, with their children, are
treated with great tenderness and care.</p>

<p>Some of the merchants had as many as three
female slaves a-piece; but it is to be observed, that
they are mere girls. The Africans who can afford
to indulge their tastes, abhor women of any age.
All their slaves are of tender years. The older these<a name="page219" id="page219"></a><span class="pageno">[219]</span>
gentlemen get, the younger they require their concubines
to be. An aged sinner of Aghadez had a
mere child with him. En-Noor is said to have
half-a-dozen stout girls running about his house.
Really, to satisfy the passions and sensuality of these
Africans, women should be like the houris of Paradise,
and never grow old. Those that accompanied
us were, of course, regarded as mistresses, but were
required also to do nearly all the drudgery of the
caravan. Their masters must have sold much
prettier and finer girls at Gh&acirc;t.</p>

<p>The name of the place where we are now encamped
is, as I have said, Takeesat, and that of
the rocky plain we traversed between Esalan
and Aisou is [<i>omitted in Journal</i>]. We shall now
have great confusion in the denominations of places,
the Tuaricks using one name and the Kailouees
another.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;We rose early, and at four o'clock were
already in motion. It was a long and weary day&mdash;fourteen
hours of actual travelling; but this, thank
Heaven! is, we are told, the last long stretch of that
kind we shall have to undertake. The country was
nearly similar to that between Falezlez and Aisou;
plains or slightly indented valleys. The granite
appeared again, with sandstone on the top. No
herbage was found to-day, except a few scanty bits
here and there.</p>

<p>In the morning our blacks all ran up to a sugar-loaf
shaped rock, which they called their altar<a name="page220" id="page220"></a><span class="pageno">[220]</span>
or temple, Jama. There they performed certain
strange incantations, after which they descended and
began to indulge in mock-fights, sometimes even
simulating an attack upon the caravan. What was
the real meaning of their pantomime it was impossible
to make out, but they amused us exceedingly
by their wild gestures and cries.</p>

<p>The three mysterious Haghars still continued to
follow us throughout the day, declaring that they
had no evil intentions, but were merely poor wayfarers
journeying to Aheer. They have made
friends with the Tanelkums, with whom they have
more points of resemblance than with the Kailouees.
In appearance and manners they are remarkable
enough. They wear a shield of bullock or rhinoceros
hide hanging down on one side of their camels.
During our march, it was evidently their desire to
show off; for they moved in order of battle as
they called it, in a line, the two who had spears
holding them bravely up. It was certainly a pretty
sight to see them play off this little exercise. But
in the evening, after dark, they returned from feeding
their camels somewhere in the mountains, and
came and bivouacked close to us and our baggage.
This alarmed us, and we sent En-Noor to remonstrate
with them. After some wrangling, they promised
to leave us if we would give them supper.
We did so, and got rid of them for the night.</p>

<p>There was some dispute this evening with the
servants about pitching our tent. I always find<a name="page221" id="page221"></a><span class="pageno">[221]</span>
them ready to escape this trouble when they can.
However, it appears that En-Noor recommended
us not to pitch our tents that we may not be known
during the night, in the event of these three Haghars
having comrades skulking after them, seeking an
opportunity to attack us.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;We rose an hour before daylight, and
journeyed eight hours, passing through a country
resembling that of yesterday, and a pleasant valley
called Wady Jeenanee, until we arrived at the wells
of the same name. They are scooped out of the sand
in a stony bed, and amidst rocks. The water is very
palatable. It has no natural source, but there is
an abundant supply for several months, and even
years, after great rains.</p>

<p>To-day we noticed, for the first time on our
journey from Tripoli, the recent marks of the fall of
a great quantity of rain. It had left after it exactly
the same forms on the sandy valley which we see at
all times, quite dry, in the more desolated regions of
the Sahara. There cannot be a doubt that occasionally
an immense quantity of rain falls in every
region of this great desert.</p>

<p>The senna plant was picked up again to-day,
and the tree called aborah appeared in great numbers
in the wady, in a corner of which we encamped.</p>

<p>Although our friends, the three Haghars, promised
to leave us for ever if they had a supper,
yesterday they appeared again <i>en route</i> to chat with
their Tanelkum acquaintances. God knows, they<a name="page222" id="page222"></a><span class="pageno">[222]</span>
may be honest men&mdash;in reality, poor devils obliged
to beg their way to Aheer. They wander about
here and there. (I have not seen them this evening,
five P.M.)</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that the blacks of our caravan
(mostly slaves) walked on foot fourteen long, long
hours yesterday, they still danced, and sang, and
played games in the evening, and kept it up till midnight!
How capable are these Africans of bearing
up against fatigue and toil! Could we Europeans do
as they do? Not even in our own country, and
under our own climate.</p>

<p>They afterwards made a collection of small
articles of clothing, and other little things. I gave
them a handkerchief, with which they were greatly
delighted.</p>

<p>We had a perfect Soudan atmosphere to-day.
The heavens were surcharged with clouds, and
when the sun appeared through them for a few
minutes, it was burning, scorching hot. The abundance
of herbage and trees in Wady Jeenanee combined
with these circumstances to show that we had
entered the gates of a new climate.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i><a name="anchor9" id="anchor9"></a><a href="#footnote9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;We started late, seven A.M., and journeyed
about six hours, the camels eating nearly all
the way, which gave our Tuarick caravan the appearance
of a company of Arabs. To-day the herbage
and trees increased, in abundance and variety, and<a name="page223" id="page223"></a><span class="pageno">[223]</span>
we saw several pretty wild flowers. We observed
many Soudan trees, or trees with tropical aspects.
Our route lay through rocky valleys, over a bed of
fine granite sand. The rocks were all blackened,
forming a gloomy landscape, especially as all the
morning the heavens were one impenetrable mass
of clouds. The atmosphere felt, at first, damp and
suffocating; but at length the wind got up, and we
breathed more freely.</p>

</div>

<p>As we advanced, on the 21st, along the plain between
the granite rocks&mdash;trees and flowers starting
up thicker and thicker from the ground to greet our
approach&mdash;our guides told us that we were at length
entering the inhabited districts of the kingdom of
Aheer, or Asben, as it is indifferently called. This
announcement at once substituted pleasurable for
uneasy sensations. We thought no more at all of
pursuing robbers, and gave ourselves up to the
delight which always attends upon difficulties vanquished.
The name of the first district is Taghajeet.<a name="page225" id="page225"></a><span class="pageno">[225]</span>
We expected to behold groups of inhabitants coming
joyfully to welcome us. Our imaginations
had adorned this country almost with the colours of
home. It was about one that we crossed the unmarked
frontier. Still there were rocks around,
their angles softened away by trees; still wild
flowers mingled with the herbage on every side;
the heavens were clearing overhead, and the sun
shed down a warm mantle of rays upon the land;
yet there were no signs of life. The silence that
reigned, I know not why, introduced ideas of terror
into our minds, and we began to gaze anxiously to
the right and to the left. We remembered that this
region, likewise, was inhabited by Tuaricks, though
not of the Haghar tribe. They might be inhospitable,
perhaps hostile. All the caravan, by degrees,
seemed to join in our uneasiness; and when at
length, just before we pitched our tent, the cry
arose of "The Tuaricks! the Tuaricks are coming!"
it rose as a cry of warning and alarm. Every one
snatched up his weapons as a small group approached;
and all waited with impatience to learn
whether they came as friends or enemies.</p>

<p>Our uneasiness was soon quieted. The newcomers
were known to some of our people, the Tanelkums,
and soon scraped acquaintance with us.
They paid a visit to my tent, and I gave them a
number of little things, with which they were very
much gratified. There was reason, then, to hope
that our first impressions of security were well-founded,<a name="page226" id="page226"></a><span class="pageno">[226]</span>
and I began writing my journal as if we
had really arrived in a land of peace.</p>

<p>Suddenly a man, mounted on a maharee, brought
us news, at first in a friendly way, that an immense
number of Tuaricks were pursuing us; and then,
throwing off the mask, in their name demanded of
our escort that they should deliver us up to them.
This demand the Kailouees, of course, rejected with
indignation; but the circumstance put our people
on the <i>qui vive</i>, and we kept up a fire of musketry
for two or three hours during the succeeding night.</p>

<p>At sunset, Waldee, the great merchant of Mourzuk,
came to the encampment. His caravan was
stopping half an hour higher up. He gave us much
encouragement, and eloquently recommended us to
the care of all our people, the camel-drivers and
escort. Waldee has travelled this route fourteen
years. He is just the man to do it,&mdash;a small spare
fellow with an expression of much intelligence,
which he really possesses. He is the most respected
of all the merchants on this route.</p>

<p>When he left us, he sent us a present of Aheer
dates, which were large and exceedingly well tasted.</p>

<p><i>22d.</i>&mdash;We stopped in the valley of Taghajeet all
day, waiting for the Haghars, but they did not make
their appearance. In the morning early, I distributed
powder and shot to about forty of our people.
Each had half a cupfull of powder and twelve shots.
It was an immense present for them, and they were
all greatly rejoiced at the gift. It is extremely<a name="page227" id="page227"></a><span class="pageno">[227]</span>
difficult for people to obtain powder and shot in
these countries. We made a line of barricades with
the boat. Amongst our defenders appeared the three
Azgher Tuaricks,<a name="anchor10" id="anchor10"></a><a href="#footnote10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> who followed us from Tajetterat,
and overtook us above the well of Aisou. We gave
them powder and shot, and they swore they would
die for us.</p>

<p>In the evening two mounted men came up, and
made the same demand of our escort that the single
man had made the night before; namely, that they
should give us Christians up to forty or fifty Tuaricks,
collected from the various districts around.
This impudent demand was again rejected.</p>

<p>The opinion of all the caravan now seemed to be,
that this was an idle threat of some dozen bandits,
and that the people generally would not turn out
inimical.</p>

<p>Merchant Waldee came again this evening, and
gave us increased encouragement not to be afraid.</p>

<p>The more we saw of this man the better we liked
him. He brought for us, also, the favourable news
that the Sheikh of Bornou was on good terms with
his neighbours, the people of Wada&iuml; and Darfour.
I shall endeavour to return <i>vi&acirc;</i> these countries to
the Mediterranean, if possible. Our people fired
again to-night. In the evening I presented Boro
of Aghadez with a fine burnouse, and his son with<a name="page228" id="page228"></a><span class="pageno">[228]</span>
a shasheeah and a fateh. I gave a fateh also to one
of his relations, who is travelling with him. He was
highly pleased with the gift, and expressed his pleasure
in many compliments. Of giving gifts there
is no end; but this is the time, or never, when they
will be useful.</p>

<p><i>23d.</i>&mdash;Before we started, another fellow came
riding up from the rumoured troop of bandits, and
demanded of our escort that they should give us into
their hands. Boro remembered his present, and
expressed his gratitude by resenting this insolence
with a perfect shower of abuse.</p>

<p>We advanced nine hours this day, looking behind
us as we moved. Our course lay through a
rocky country, and two or three fine valleys, distinguished
chiefly by the immense size of the
tholukh-trees. In the afternoon a large valley
opened, amidst a mountainous region; after traversing
which, we pitched tent in a small open
space surrounded with hills, with a snug valley of
hasheesh near at hand.</p>

<p>When we started in the morning, we bade the
merchant Waldee adieu. During the night he had
received a courier from Mourzuk, and letters from
the Consul and Mustapha Bey to recommend us to
him. Waldee said he would write us some letters,
and send them after us. He leaves his caravan at
Taghajeet, and mounts his maharee for Mourzuk,
where he expects to arrive in the course of fourteen
days.<a name="page229" id="page229"></a><span class="pageno">[229]</span></p>

<p>I wrote by him to Government, and to my wife.</p>

<p>In the evening, when it was nearly dusk, five
mounted men made their appearance, two of them
leading six empty camels. We did not like the
looks of them, but they gave a tolerable account of
themselves.</p>

<p>I treated them to supper&mdash;in fact, I am obliged
to feed all strangers, as well as a good number of
the caravan. Of feeding these people, as of giving
them presents, verily there is no end. To travel
comfortably in the desert, it would be necessary to
possess Fortunatus' purse or Aladdin's lamp.</p>

<p>During the night these strange fellows disappeared,
which circumstance naturally aroused our
suspicions. About two in the morning the Kailouees,
wishing to start early, began to bustle about
in the dark, in order to collect their camels. They
could not find any of them. Great was the consternation.
The Tanelkums instantly ran to their
drove, of which three only were missing, and ours
also were found to be safe. They have driven the
camels off, in order to prevent our progress, and
give time to the enemy to come up.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;We naturally passed the remainder of the
night in the greatest anxiety of mind, feeling sure that
a crisis was now approaching. At about six in the
morning, four men, mounted on maharees, came riding
towards us, and drawing near, boldly summoned
our escort to deliver up the Christians, with all their
baggage and camels. The insolence of this small<a name="page230" id="page230"></a><span class="pageno">[230]</span>
body assured us that they had some force at hand;
but we boldly told them to go about their business,
as we were resolved to defend ourselves to the last.</p>

<p>Whilst we were parleying with them, a troop of
about forty men, mounted on their fleet maharees,
and equipped for war with spears, shields, and
swords, came trotting rapidly over the hills, hallooing
with wild cries, and challenging our caravan
to battle. When the first few moments of surprise
had subsided, two-thirds of our caravan, armed with
matchlocks, pistols, and swords, advanced in a body,
and shouted out that they accepted the challenge.
This bold movement staggered the assailants, who
forthwith began to waver and retire. They had
evidently expected to overawe us by boasting. Our
people, satisfied with the effect of their manoeuvre,
retired slowly towards the encampment. Presently
a small body of the enemy advanced as a deputation,
demanding to parley, and declaring that they
did not come to fight against people of their own
faith. The remainder pretended to march and countermarch
along the hills on either hand, as if to hem
us in completely, but kept at a respectful distance.
They saw that we were too strong for them, but called
out that they would go and fetch more people.</p>

<p>The conferences were now fairly opened, and
we found that the hostile troop was composed of a
collection of all the Sheikhs of the neighbouring
districts, with their followers, and several regular
bandits, countenanced by a Shereef Marabout. Our<a name="page231" id="page231"></a><span class="pageno">[231]</span>
people understood at once that the affair was far
more serious than they had anticipated, and began
to be downhearted. They knew that they could not
proceed without their camels, and from their expressions
and looks I could foresee that the matter
at last would have to be ended by a compromise.</p>

<p>The enemy made various propositions, more or
less agreeable to our ears. The first was simply
that we, as infidels, should be given up to be put to
death&mdash;an idea which, luckily, nobody seemed to
consider proper or feasible. They then insisted
that we should pass on no further, but should return
by the way we had come&mdash;also declined. Next,
they demanded that we should become Muslims&mdash;a
proposition which our people refused even to mention
to us. Finally, they coolly asked for half our
goods and baggage,&mdash;no doubt their ultimate object.</p>

<p>When they found that we would not agree to
any of their proposals, but were determined rather to
resist by the strong hand, a compromise was agreed
upon. We paid them in goods to the value of
three hundred and fifty reals, or about fifty pounds
sterling, in order to get back our camels and be
allowed to proceed. Even then, however, our
caravan lost nine animals; so that the Kailouees
suffer more even than we do. We were obliged to
put up with all this, and were glad enough when
the Shereef Marabout at length professed himself
satisfied, and volunteered his protection for the
future.<a name="page232" id="page232"></a><span class="pageno">[232]</span></p>

<p>A wild and lawless set are these borderers of
Aheer. The gathering was evidently a spontaneous
one of all the blackguards of the country. Even
the marabout complains, that during the expedition
he has lost his burnouse, carpet, and fez, whilst he
was saying his prayers, pious man! and beseeching
for strength to overcome the infidels! He was on
his knees, when a fellow of his troop came softly
up behind, appropriated his things, mounted his
camel, and fled away&mdash;"whist," he says, like the
wind, and was soon out of sight, and appeared no
more. By the way, the three Azghers were frightened,
or corrupted, in the morning, and went over
to the enemy. They change sides with fortune;
and when some shots were fired by the enemy, by
way of bravado and to expedite the conferences, one
of their muskets was brought into play, and of
course my powder! I am happy to reflect, however,
that they got none of the booty this time, and
have "'filed their minds" for nought.</p>

<p>As soon as we got back our camels we proposed
to, move on, our people evincing the greatest
anxiety to get away from a place where such disagreeable
things had happened. We accordingly
marched about two hours, the marabouts accompanying
us, and then pitched tent for the night.
Sinister rumours, however, were still about, like a
flight of ill-omened birds, and it was said that another
troop of people were collecting further on to
intercept our passage to Soudan. During this halt,<a name="page233" id="page233"></a><span class="pageno">[233]</span>
grave conferences were held between the Kailouee
merchant, En-Noor, and the marabout, on the
subject of these fresh reports. It turned out that
there were several people in the neighbourhood who
were dissatisfied that they had not shared in the
booty, and might prove troublesome. About thirty
reals' worth of things were accordingly selected for
them.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;We started before daylight, and advanced
about nine hours, pitching tent in the afternoon at
three. Our people are in better spirits, anticipating
the termination of the journey. However, we are
not yet free from cause of alarm. The Tanelkums,
our companions, begin to show symptoms of discontent,
and in the evening I was obliged to make
presents to the whole of them. They have certainly
worked hard for us, and suffered much anxiety on
our account.</p>

<p>Our course this day lay towards the mountains
of Tidek, which form our southern horizon. The
country was a perfect desert. There was nothing
now to tell that we were near Soudan, except perhaps
a few tholukh-trees of gigantic stature. We
did not halt upon the track, but, turning aside,
sought a fine valley, where there was abundance of
hasheesh. Our camels greedily devour the luxuriant
<i>bou rekaba</i>.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;As usual, the caravan was got into marching
order before daybreak, and returning to the
track we proceeded rapidly. Dawn revealed to us<a name="page234" id="page234"></a><span class="pageno">[234]</span>
that we were still watched by the hostile population.
Three men, mounted on maharees, trotted along the
hills, evidently in observation. We soon got out of
the desert country, and entered the fine wady of
Kaltadak, rich with tropical vegetation. The huge
tholukhs were covered with a multitude of parasitical
plants, that hung in festoons or trailed down
towards the earth. This valley runs winding round
about the group of Tidek mountains, which have
long been in view. They say that it abounds in
lions, and as we advanced we looked down the long
glades that opened on either hand, expecting to see
some monarch of the forest stopping to gaze at us
as we passed. We discovered, however, only three
black ostriches moving slowly along in the distance,&mdash;the
first I have seen wild in Africa. They appeared
like dark moving lumps, the heads and
necks not being discernible to the naked eye. Our
people did not attempt to chase them; and the
gazelles that glanced near at hand were likewise
suffered to depart in peace. At noon we reached
the well of Anamghur, where we drank some good
water. It was scooped out of the sandy, rocky bed
of the wady. A group of five asses had been driven
down to it to drink.</p>

<p>As we advanced, about noon, a small group appeared
ahead. A person of consequence from
Seloufeeat, known to our escort, was coming to
meet us. He advanced cordially, and told us that
he had determined to be our protection. We were<a name="page235" id="page235"></a><span class="pageno">[235]</span>
sorry that any such aid was necessary; but it appeared
from his report that there were more people
collecting to attack the Christians, and get a share
of their spoils. In the evening we encamped in an
open space clear of the trees, where we could see all
around us, and use our arms if necessary. Scarcely
were we established when a troop of fifty men came
near in a threatening manner, but did not attack
us. After dark, they increased to about a hundred.
They consisted of the sheikhs of the districts, with
their followers and lawless men scraped together
from various quarters. Meanwhile our escort, who
were anxious for their own safety as well as ours,
had sent on to the City of Marabouts, Tintaghoda,
and had prevailed on several of these holy men to
protect them and us. The night was spent in conference
instead of in repose. The hostile Sheikhs
told our marabouts that they did not come to harm
us, but to oblige us to become Muslims, for no infidel
had ever, or ever should, pass through their
country. This proposition was at once, as a matter
of business and profession, approved of by our protecting
marabouts. What priest ever shrunk from
the prospect of a conversion?</p>

<p>Matters having come to this point, our escort,
camel-drivers and servants, could not but communicate
to us the demand made&mdash;namely, that
we should change our religion or return by the way
we had come. This time, likewise, even our own
servants prayed that we would accept the proposition,<a name="page236" id="page236"></a><span class="pageno">[236]</span>
or seem to accept it, if only for a few days, to
deliver ourselves from present danger. My colleagues,
and particularly Dr. Barth, indignantly
and passionately resisted. For my part, I looked
upon the affair with a little more calm, the same
thing having occurred to me on a former occasion
in these deserts. I told our people that we would
pay the tribute imposed by the Mahometan law on
infidels, or for our passage through the country, or
else that we would take our chance and return.
Upon this our servants exclaimed, with tears in their
eyes, "To return would be certain death!" There
was now nothing left for me to do but to say, with
my colleagues, that we would wait patiently for
death, but that to change our religion was impossible.</p>

<p>Although, of course, the threats that were made
against us could not but produce considerable uneasiness,
I always felt pretty sure that the Sheikhs
did not exactly mean what they said, and would
come at last, as had the others, to a money compromise.
Yet, during the absence of our people,
who took the message that we were ready to die for
the honour of our country and religion, I passed, as
did my friends the Germans, a most distressing half
hour. Every sound we heard seemed to be that of
people approaching to attack us. At length we
heard voices, through the darkness. Our ambassadors
were coming back with the message: "It is
arranged, O Consuls, that you shall pay a certain<a name="page237" id="page237"></a><span class="pageno">[237]</span>
sum of money!" Children of the desert, you are
not the only ones who make a demand for conscience
sake, and then compound for cash!</p>

<p>We only afterwards learned how this negotiation
was carried on with the enemy. Some dramatic
scenes were reported to us by our servants
as occurring between our escort and the assailing
troop, mixed with marabouts. En-Noor, on returning
from us after we had declared that we
would die for our religion, drew his sword and cast
it on the ground before the people, calling out to
the other Kailouees, "Come now, let us all die with
the Christians!" On the other hand, the fiercest
of the enemy every now and then got up and made
as if they would rush at once and spear us in our
tents. Then there was reasoning of every description,
and tremendous quotations from the Koran.
The most humane proposed that we should have ten
days' grace to reflect on our situation before we
were put to death. Our servants, who behaved
well all through this trying business, made a reasonable
proposition, that we should be taken to Tintalous
to the great Sultan En-Noor, who should
decide upon our case. But this did not suit the
purpose of these pious propagandists of the Muslim
faith, who swore that the book ordered them to
slaughter the unbelievers, and at length were graciously
pleased to accept the sum of thirty-five
pounds sterling in goods!</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;In the morning we wished to start at<a name="page238" id="page238"></a><span class="pageno">[238]</span>
once, and get away from this scene of our second
disaster; but we had to stay to select the goods
which were to pay for our lives, liberties, and consciences.
However, we at length got off; and
whilst the bandits were swearing, and griping one
another by the throat, and fighting over the booty,
we pushed hastily on towards Seloufeeat, which,
according to our Tanelkums, is really the first
country of Asben. As we entered the valley our
people kept up a running fire, to alarm any one
who might feel disposed to attack us. We had
been so much accustomed to inhospitality and robbers
of late, that we confidently expected further
difficulties as soon as we met with the inhabitants.</p>

<p>After a march of four hours we arrived, and
encamped in the neighbourhood of Seloufeeat.
The valley has quite a Soudan appearance, but
solely on account of the presence of the doom palm.
There are, however, a considerable number of other
trees, particularly the souak, the branches of which
are eaten voraciously by our camels. It has beautiful
green foliage, and is very bushy and spreading.
Wheat, and ghaseb, and other grain are grown in
the valley, where there is abundance of good water.
The wells are like those of Ghadamez,&mdash;that is to
say, an upright beam with a long cross-pole, having a
stone at one end and a rope and bucket at the other,
serves to bring up the water.</p>

<p>We found here a caravan about to proceed
direct to Mourzuk, and I seized the opportunity to<a name="page239" id="page239"></a><span class="pageno">[239]</span>
write by it to Government and to my wife. During
the night some mischievous people again drove away
all the camels of the Kailouees, as well as ours. This
disturbed us much, and we anticipated fresh extortion
and plunder; but we were assured that we had
now nothing serious to apprehend.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;We stopped here all day to get back our
camels. The caravan was delayed, and I wrote a
detailed account of our two affairs to Government.</p>

<p>A nephew of Sultan En-Noor came to Seloufeeat
this morning, having heard, probably, of our arrival.
By him I wrote to En-Noor, from whom
we expect an answer to-morrow.</p>

<p>In the evening eleven camels of the Kailouees
were still missing, and six of ours. Nevertheless,
our people determined to go on next morning. I
felt much discouraged this evening. A succession of
bad affairs was constantly contradicting the assurances
of our escort and their friends; the people of Seloufeeat
were also excessively troublesome: there seemed
no one in the place having authority. At last, near
sunset, came forward a certain Haj Bashaw, declaring
that we had all been too badly treated, and
he would obtain for us redress. This man has
considerable wealth, and is in constant communication
with Mourzuk, where he sends numbers of
slaves, and possesses property. He probably began
to quake for his property in Mourzuk, fearing the
Turks would make reprisals. I went to bed with
the assurance of this man that he would get back for<a name="page240" id="page240"></a><span class="pageno">[240]</span>
us our camels; nevertheless, having been deceived a
thousand times, I had my misgivings. Yet I did not
forget we had twice been delivered out of the hands
of bandits by our escort and friends, so that we
ought not to despair of seeing a brighter and a
quieter time. After midnight I had a few hours
of refreshing sleep.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Aug. 29th.</i>&mdash;I rose early, and heard the good news
that the camels missing in the first affair were found
and brought to our people. This filled everybody
with good spirits, and we got off as soon as we could
from Seloufeeat. We were obliged to leave the boat
in the charge of a faithful inhabitant, to fetch as soon,
as we arrived at Tintaghoda. Before starting, Haj
Bashaw made Yusuf write a letter in his name to
Mourzuk, to the Bashaw Mustapha and Makersee,
declaring that he had not had any news of us or<a name="page242" id="page242"></a><span class="pageno">[242]</span>
our coming, but that now we should be conducted
safely up to the country of En-Noor. This is the only
man who seems to have any authority in Seloufeeat:
the marabouts could do little before he came forward;
the people live in the wildest state of lawless
independence.</p>

<p>In the morning before starting, the Sfaxee and
Yusuf came up to me and said, "All up to now was
lies; but henceforth all is truth. You have nothing
more to fear&mdash;there is nothing now but good." This
speech I most devoutly devoured, and things certainly
wore a brighter aspect this morning. But we
now anxiously wait news from En-Noor.</p>

<p>We moved up the valley of Seloufeeat, our spirits
buoyant and mounting high, whilst the air of the
morning was soft and fresh, not unlike that of Italy.
After two hours we arrived at the City of Marabouts,
or Tintaghoda.</p>

<p>There is considerable variety in the physiognomy
of the people of Aheer, whom we have already seen;
but in general, they have agreeable countenances:
and as to stature, many of them are very tall, though
apparently not very robust. Some are of light olive
complexion, with straight noses and thin lips; but
others, indeed the great number, approximate to the
negro in feature.</p>

<p>This portion of Aheer is still poor in provisions.
Indeed, all these districts are strictly Saharan.
There are fine fertile valleys, but between them are
rocks and complete deserts; the trees, which somewhat<a name="page243" id="page243"></a><span class="pageno">[243]</span>
change from the aspect of those in Central
Sahara, are the immensely large tholukhs, some of
them covered with parasitical plants; the doom palm,
and the souak tree. I have also seen the ethel
hereabouts.</p>

<p>The houses of Seloufeeat and Tintaghoda have,
however, a true African aspect, being thatched with
leaves of the doom palm. Some of them are sheds,
with a roof supported by four poles, under which the
people repose in the shade by day and by night
shelter themselves from noxious vapours.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary reports are beginning to
circulate about us and our affairs. It has been confidently
spread about that the three Azgher, who
followed us from Tajetterat, had a letter in their
possession, which they were to show to all the population
beyond the Gh&acirc;t territory, written by Khanouhen,
to the effect that we were to be murdered,
as soon as we got beyond that territory, by whomsoever
the attempt might be made.</p>

<p>Another report is, that the sixty maharees, said
to have been in pursuit of us at Taghajeet, did
actually arrive at that district, but finding us too
far ahead for them they returned; they came by the
way of Tuat. These Haghars were to have fallen
upon us during the night, and murdered all of us,
even the Tanelkums, except Oud-el-Khair and two
others. There is a route which leads direct to
Tuat from Taghajeet, and also another from Aisou
to Tuat.<a name="page244" id="page244"></a><span class="pageno">[244]</span></p>

<p>With regard to the marabouts, they seem quiet
enough. It would appear there is an enormous
fellow amongst them, who every year, during one
night, flies to Mekka and back again.</p>

<p>They report to the people that, insomuch as we
are recommended by the great Sultan of the Turks,
Abd-el-Majeed, by the Pasha of Tripoli, and all his
marabouts, by the Pasha and great marabouts of
Mourzuk, by all the big and mighty people of Gh&acirc;t
and the Haghars, but more especially as they have
found our names written in their books, and that we
were to come to them and visit their holy city,&mdash;with
a thousand other such reasons&mdash;they (the marabouts)
have determined to receive us with open
arms. The marabouts of all countries pretend to
find events written plainly, or shadowed forth, in
their books.</p>

<p>After giving away about a hundred and fifty
pounds sterling, the greatest part, however, forced
gifts, we have received our first present in Aheer,
viz. two melons, some onions, and a small quantity of
wheat this evening, from Haj Bashaw, the influential
man of Seloufeeat, already mentioned. There is
still a drawback in this, for the giver knew the father
of Yusuf, and was anxious to show favour to his
son, my interpreter. But the fact must be recorded
as something wonderful.</p>

<p>The people of our caravan, escort and camel-drivers,
offer us nothing; to them it would appear a
sin to give anything to a Christian. Such are the<a name="page245" id="page245"></a><span class="pageno">[245]</span>
people we travel with. In regard to the matter of
presents, God give me patience with them.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;There is no answer from En-Noor, nor
are our camels forthcoming; which things naturally
cause us anxiety. But let us hope for the best, and
pray to God to deliver us from all our misfortunes.</p>

<p>We wait here to-day to see the results, and proceed
to-morrow. This morning I made the account
of the forced passage of the expedition from Taghajeet
to this place (Marabouteen). It amounts to the
enormous sum of nine hundred mahboubs&mdash;more than
one hundred and fifty pounds sterling! I do not know
what Government will think of it; but the expenditure
incurred was certainly to save our lives.</p>

<p>I gave this morning more presents to our
servants, and lectured them on their duties. All
things considered, they have behaved very well.
When they saw the great quantity of goods given
away or forced from us by strangers, they naturally
began to think what there would be left for them,
who always remained with us, and worked for us.</p>

<p>The being chief of an expedition of this kind is
certainly no sinecure; but I am sure that no one
who has not occupied a similar post can conceive
the anxieties and disquietudes under which I have
laboured during all these difficult days. Almost
ever since our departure from Gh&acirc;t we have been in
fear, either for our lives or our property. Danger
has ever hung hovering over us, sometimes averted,
sometimes seeming to be turned into smoke; but<a name="page246" id="page246"></a><span class="pageno">[246]</span>
within this week the strokes of ill fortune have fallen
upon us with increasing fury. We try to persuade
ourselves that there is now nothing more to fear,
and every one joins in nursing what may be a
delusion.</p>

<p>The marabouts indulge the vain hope that,
through the influence of the great En-Noor of
Tintalous, we may yet become Muslims. It would
appear that the whole of the inhabitants of the
village of Tintaghoda are marabouts, and so the
race of saints is propagated from generation to
generation. Generally, the children of the marabouts
are good-looking. It is said that some of the
mischievous boys were the parties who drove off our
cattle.</p>

<p>In spite of all the sanctity of this place, and its
reputation that it is free from theft, En-Noor of
our escort told us yesterday evening to watch well
during the night, that our things might not be
stolen.</p>

<p>We Christians cannot trust our things here.
The Sfaxee, however, leaves his goods in the place,
and will go with us to-morrow. Tintaghoda may
be a safe d&eacute;p&ocirc;t for Muslims, not for Christians.</p>

<p>I have omitted to notice in its proper place, but
may record here, that one of the free black females
was lost for a couple of days in the desert, and recovered
after the disaster.</p>

<p>Whatever we have yet seen of Aheer in a geological
point of view, shows that it is essentially a region<a name="page247" id="page247"></a><span class="pageno">[247]</span>
of granite rocks, between which are a series of fine
valleys, running one into another. The granite is in
great varieties; there are four specimens of granite
marble; some pieces of pure limestone marble have
also been collected; the granite rocks are blackened
by the sun and atmosphere, and wear the appearance
of basalt.</p>

<p>About four o'clock this afternoon there was a cry
in the encampment&mdash;not that the Haghar were
coming&mdash;not that another troop of robbers and
wild people were advancing upon us to attack us;
but the cry was, "<i>El wady jaee!</i>" "The wady is
coming!" Going out to look, I saw a broad white
sheet of foam advancing from the south between the
trees of the valley. In ten minutes after a river of
water came pouring along, and spread all around
us, converting the place of our encampment into an
isle of the valley. The current in its deepest part
was very powerful, capable of carrying away sheep
and cattle, and of uprooting trees. This is one of
the most interesting phenomena I have witnessed
during my present tour in Africa. The scene,
indeed, was perfectly African. Rain had been observed
falling in the south; black clouds and
darkness covered that zone of the heavens; and
an hour afterwards came pouring down this river
of water into the dry, parched-up valley. This
incident of Wady Tintaghoda explains the Scriptural
phrase, "rivers of waters;" for here indeed was a
river of water, appearing in an instant, and almost<a name="page248" id="page248"></a><span class="pageno">[248]</span>
without notice. It is not, however, necessary to
come to the frontiers of Soudan to witness phenomena,
of this nature. Even in Morocco similar
sudden floodings occur every rainy season.</p>

<p>We had been some time employed in watching
this singular scene, when another cry was heard.
This was the announcement that our camels
were coming,&mdash;certainly a piece of good news that
we had been anxiously expecting; but it had often
been given before, and after the first excitement
we began to feel the sickness of disappointment.
However, four of our camels were in reality brought
in; there yet remain out two of ours and three
belonging to the Kailouees. However, our spirits
begin now really to revive. We learn that this act
of restitution is attributable to the marabouts.</p>

<p>I went to bed on receiving this news; but I had
not rested long before Dr. Barth called out, "Have
you heard what has happened? Twenty-eight maharees
are arrived from En-Noor." On further inquiries,
I learned that the Sultan had sent us an
escort of twenty men mounted, and eight on foot;
but rain having fallen and still continuing to fall, and
the fact of our being surrounded by water, prevented
the approach of these troops to the encampment.
The intelligence of their arrival was brought by a
man well known to the Tanelkums. In the afternoon
we had heard that En-Noor had received a
confused account of our two encounters with the
armed bands, and that we had been destroyed by<a name="page249" id="page249"></a><span class="pageno">[249]</span>
them, or nearly so, but had not yet received our
courier. This circumstance tranquillised us. We
had been anxiously expecting news from En-Noor.
The people always speak of maharees, and not of
mounted men; so that twenty maharees are twenty
men mounted on maharees. It rained this evening
and during the night: everything was damp around
us. We now begin to feel, indeed, that we are in a
humid atmosphere.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>&mdash;I rose early, but it rained hard, and everybody
kept within tent. I am much delighted with
my double Bornou tent, for, although it is nothing
but a species of gauze cotton-work, it still keeps
out the rain.</p>

<p>We are collecting the names and qualities of the
chief among our assailants, as we shall have to make
a formal complaint against them, not only in order
to obtain restitution for our goods, but for the sake
of any future travellers. The people who first
attacked us are called El-Fadeea, or El-Fadayan,
and are styled by Yusuf <i>Arab</i> Tuaricks, or Tuaricks
living in tents. This tribe was joined by bandits
and a few adventurers from all the surrounding
districts.</p>

<p>The people of the second attack are called
Aghazar: these are also Arab Tuaricks, or people
living in tents. They were joined by people from
Seloufeeat, Tintaghoda, and all the neighbouring
places.</p>

<p>The people appear to have gathered all confusedly<a name="page250" id="page250"></a><span class="pageno">[250]</span>
together, headed by their chiefs and countenanced
by the marabouts, to destroy the Infidels who were
come to pollute their country; but, undoubtedly,
the major part were excited against us by the hope
of plunder.</p>

<p>All the inhabitants of Ghanet<a name="anchor11" id="anchor11"></a><a href="#footnote11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> are Maghata, or
descendants of the children of the Tuaricks, Haghar
and Azgher, which were born to them by their slaves.
It is these Maghata who were said to be in pursuit
of us under Sidi Jafel. There are many of the
same people in the open desert, for the most part
bandits, or at least inclined to that way of life.
They levy contributions on the caravans, and on the
settled people when they can venture.</p>

<p>The valley, which embraces Seloufeeat and Tintaghoda,
is said to extend, by a series of connexions,
as far as Zinder,&mdash;probably a fanciful connexion of
the people. It is a most picturesque wady, lined
with black granite rocks, some rising high into
castellated peaks on the south-east, with a lower
range of hills on the north-west. It is not above
half a mile wide in its mean breadth; herbage does
not abound over all its bed, but trees cover its
surface. The water is mostly rain water; here and
there, however, springs are found. All the water is
good, and copious in supply.</p>

<p>If we may judge from what we have seen of
the marks of late rains in these districts, and the<a name="page251" id="page251"></a><span class="pageno">[251]</span>
freshness of the herbage, the rainy season is just
beginning in Aheer. There is not yet very abundant
herbage, but it will soon greatly increase.</p>

<p>The rain continues to pour in torrents, the
boundary mountains on either hand are scarcely
visible, and a watery vapour prevents us from
tracing the course of the valley. We have hitherto
had to struggle against mental anxieties, against
fatigues, heat, drought, and thirst: we have now
to contend with rain and with floods. Everything
is becoming awfully damp, and everybody looks
awfully dismal. I can see, from the lugubrious
countenances of the Kailouees and the blacks, that
the rainy season is their real winter. They go
shivering about, and seem as if they were half
drowned. Our Bornou gauze-cotton tent still bears
up well, however, and keeps out the rain.</p>

<p>I was engaged in admiring the tent, and in reflecting
on the changed region into which we had
entered&mdash;a region of luxuriant vegetation and
watery atmosphere&mdash;when there was again a wild
holloa of "The floods are pouring down upon us!
The wady is coming!" Our people, however, contented
themselves at first with shouting, and made no
preparations for the advancing flood; but in a short
time they found it necessary to bestir themselves,
and began to make dams and dykes, with the aid
of sticks and hatches. These expedients proved
of no avail. The waters swelled wildly up, higher
and higher, and sheets of foaming waves came<a name="page252" id="page252"></a><span class="pageno">[252]</span>
whirling in amongst us. I called out to Yusuf
to select some high ground at once, to which our
goods might be conveyed. He calmly replied,
"The people still stay where they are;" implying
that there was no danger, that the inundation
would subside like the former one, and that we
should escape with a wetting. Not so, however.
All the low parts of the valley were already covered
with a turbid stream, that broke fiercely round the
trunks of the trees; and at length the mounting
tide threatened our tent. Yusuf then made a little
child's dam around, as if in sport; but in a few
minutes this was swept away, and we found ourselves
standing in the water.</p>

<p>It was now absolutely necessary to move; and
our people, who seemed until then to have been
paralysed by the humidity, as we in northern climates
sometimes are with cold, began to bestir
themselves, and to transfer our tents and baggage
to a piece of ground which rose considerably above
the level of the valley, and was surrounded with
rushing waters. The remainder of the caravan
imitated us, and we soon saw them all occupying
the summits of little islands, whither the camels,
at least such as did not instinctively take refuge
there themselves, were also driven. This was a
good opportunity of seeing a specimen of African
character. The Kailouees made no preparation for
the deluge until the last moment, and then seemed
absolutely to make the worst possible. They rolled<a name="page253" id="page253"></a><span class="pageno">[253]</span>
their bales of dry goods in the water as if they
were so many logs of wood, although by lifting
them up a little all might have at first been
saved quite dry. Meanwhile the black servants
were dancing, singing, and rolling about in the
waters, as if some sudden blessing had overtaken
them.<a name="anchor12" id="anchor12"></a><a href="#footnote12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The water still continued to rise, and to foam
over the margin of the island. We were compelled
by degrees to retreat towards the centre,
and as there was no sign of abatement, and as
the whole valley had become one rushing river,
covered with floating trees,&mdash;some shooting singly
along, others entangled into rafts or floating islands,
I began to entertain serious misgivings. Never
was there a more perfect picture of a deluge! It
was the Biblical deluge in miniature: and I calculated
with intense interest how many inches additional
rise would utterly destroy our goods, and
how many inches more peril our lives. The most
gloomy forebodings troubled me. I had always
looked forward to Aheer as a haven of safety, and
instead thereof it had proved to be a place of persecution.<a name="page254" id="page254"></a><span class="pageno">[254]</span>
When men had ceased to fight against us,
nature began. I thought I could hear the fanatical
people of Tintaghoda say one to the other, "Ah!
they saved their lives by money, but now God
comes in to punish and destroy them." Yet whilst
I stood apart and tortured myself in this wise, our
people, children of the day, who take no thought
for the morrow, satisfied that the waves had not
yet reached them, were full of merriment and
laughter, and seemed to mock the flood, that still
rose and rose, bending the largest trees, sweeping
away the brushwood, and roaring angrily around
the margin of the islands. Perhaps they knew
that their lives, at least, were safe; whilst I reflected
that, if even we could swim to shore, leaving
our property to the wild mercies of the waves, we
should land in an enemy's country, without the
means of satisfying the cupidity of the first bandit
who chose to attack us, and would most probably
soon be sacrificed.</p>

<p>I was anxiously watching the progress of the
inundation when at last it seemed to be checked,
and no longer to rise. God had not, then,
abandoned us, and we were not driven from the
fire to the waters to perish! The flood remained
stationary for awhile, still rolling along the valley,
which it seemed to fill from side to side; then we
noticed a slight decrease, then a progressive and
rapid one: hope buoyed up our spirits, and we
thanked the Almighty for our deliverance. As I<a name="page255" id="page255"></a><span class="pageno">[255]</span>
have mentioned, I have seen floods before, but never
one on so grand a scale as this, which was truly
African in its magnitude and character.</p>

<p>As if Providence were now resolved to visit us
with marked favour, just at the moment when the
waters began visibly to decrease, and patches of
land to appear here and there, the escort sent by
Sultan En-Noor came riding over the neighbouring
heights. Our people discovered them, and shouted,
"See, the Kailouees! the Kailouees!"</p>

<p>The waters rose above the general surface of the
wady full two feet and a-half. Had this deluge
come during the night we should scarcely have
saved ourselves; or, at any rate, the greater part
of our property and our camels must have perished.
The power of such a body of water rushing along is
tremendous. A great number of houses of Tintaghoda
were carried away, and the inhabitants declared
that they never remembered such an occurrence
to have happened before. I can well believe
them, otherwise the site of the town would have been
changed for higher ground. Trees numberless
were uprooted, and brought down by the mighty
current, which must have considerably altered the
appearance of the valley. We could already see
that the earth was ploughed up in all directions;
and when the inundation was at its height, serious
fears were entertained lest the island on which
we stood should itself be swept from under our
feet.<a name="page256" id="page256"></a><span class="pageno">[256]</span></p>

<p>When the waters had subsided a little the
nephew of En-Noor came to us from the town,
to see our situation. He then went to meet the
Maharees which had arrived from his uncle, and
soon sent to tell us that all was right, that this party
came purposely to afford us protection, and that it
included the sons of En-Noor, their nephews, and a
son-in-law, besides many household servants; in
all, thirty-one men mounted, and the rest on foot.</p>

<p>In the evening we moved out of the valley, and
encamped on the high ground. The rain continued
to incommode us. The things of the Germans
were all wet&mdash;I managed to keep mine dry; but
our sense of security now kept up our spirits.</p>

<p>Towards the evening the whole male population
came out of the town to see the ravages of water,
and learn how we fared. There might be fifty
persons, men and boys. These marabouts pretend
that when they first saw the escort of En-Noor,
they thought it was an enemy come to attack us
whilst isolated by the floods of rain.</p>

<p>They said there were some hundred bandits and
other lawless men collected behind the rocks, waiting
for us, but on seeing the escort of En-Noor
they had retired by small numbers. Certainly
there may have been some twenty or thirty such
people, and, undoubtedly, the escort of En-Noor
produced a salutary effect upon these brigands, as
well as upon the holy maraboutee population who
drove away our camels.<a name="page257" id="page257"></a><span class="pageno">[257]</span></p>

<p>When at the Marabouteen, as Tintaghoda is
called, a very fine gold-embroidered waistcoat was
brought by the escort of En-Noor to me, to ask what
it was worth. I guessed about two hundred reals;
Yusuf thought the same. It appeared that this
waistcoat was the property of Abd-el-Galeel, and was
taken as plunder during the last expedition of the
Kailouees against the Walad Suleiman. There are
several slaves also at Seloufeeat, who once were the
property of these Arabs. According to the report
of the Kailouees they have destroyed all the Walad
Suleiman,&mdash;killed them every one. They went
against the Arabs ten thousand strong; some of
the enemy, however, are said to have died of hunger.
It is, besides, reported that the people of
Bornou assisted in their destruction. Abd-el-Galeel
himself is rumoured to have been killed.
Evidently many of the unfortunate Arabs have
been surprised, and many of them slaughtered; but
I cannot believe in their total annihilation. We
shall be better informed at Zinder and Kuka.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 1st.</i>&mdash;We started late, on account of our
things being all wet. The morning was as favourable
for drying as the day before had been for wetting,
there being a high wind with sunshine. We journeyed
on five hours and a-half, and encamped near some
pools of water. A cascade during rainy weather
shoots down from the highest tops of the rocky
mountains.</p>

<p>Before us was a pleasant valley, wherein were<a name="page258" id="page258"></a><span class="pageno">[258]</span>
the ruins of huts that had been carried away by
the waters. Ferajee invited me to visit the Water
with him, and I went. In this neighbourhood
the rocky heights assumed their boldest forms,
many of the peaks being considerably elevated; all
granite.</p>

<p>Some people were heard in the evening, when
dark, and we fired several shots. The Tanelkums
had seen men skulking behind the rocks during
our short march.</p>

<p><i>2d.</i>&mdash;We rose early, and made a march of
eight hours and a-half: country as yesterday. Our
Kailouee escort left us at noon, to go to Aghooou
and Janazaret, or Zanairas, their homes. I must
write the characters of En-Noor, Deedee, and
Ferajee hereafter. They are pretty well fixed in my
memory. These individuals are amongst the number
of persons who "turned out," to use the vulgar expression,
better than we anticipated from their
first transactions with us.</p>

<p>On encamping, Mohammed, the son-in-law of
En-Noor, came to my tent, and told Yusuf that
we must now pay for our escort, as we were within a
few hours of Tintalous, and did not require it more;
also that the people wished to go to their homes,
for they had been collected from various parts of
the country. I must observe, that, considering the
time that elapsed between the departure of the
courier from Seloufeeat and the arrival of the
escort at Tintaghoda, these people had been collected<a name="page259" id="page259"></a><span class="pageno">[259]</span>
very quickly, which showed En-Noor to be a man
of business and authority.</p>

<p>I expected we should have some trouble to
satisfy thirty-one people. Yusuf, aided by the
Tanelkums, sorted out about eighty-seven reals'
worth of goods. This was offered as sufficient, but
did not content even the chief persons, much less
the smaller gentlemen. We then added another
burnouse, and other things, making up about one
hundred reals. This the chiefs accepted; but not so
the little men. They stormed and swore; and
some of them even ran to seize our bales of goods.
However, whatever we had given we should have
had the same results, and we must expect similar
quarrels all through Africa until our journey's end.
I observed, at last, that many took their portions
and retired, and I felt confident that all would finish
without violence being done us.</p>

<p>When I had been in bed two hours, half-sleeping
and half-waking, I turned round my head, and saw
my tent full of people. I had not heard them come
in. They were the Germans, Yusuf, Mohammed
Tunisee, and other people. They were all busy examining
the scattered contents of a bale of goods.
I asked what was the matter, and was told briefly
that some of the <i>canaille</i> of our escort had carried
away a bale of Dr. Barth's goods, but that the
chief had made them restore the greater part of the
spoil. In the first moments I could not help laughing.
It was certainly comical to be robbed by one's<a name="page260" id="page260"></a><span class="pageno">[260]</span>
own escort. We had now thirty-one chaouches for
two whom we obtained in Tripoli. On this I went
to sleep.</p>

<p><i>3d.</i>&mdash;Early in the morning Mohammed En-Noor
paid me a visit, and promised me that all the
things should be restored&mdash;not the smallest thing
should be lost.</p>

<p>I looked about, and saw that the greater number
of our escort had disappeared during the night,
and gone to their homes. We now commenced our
last stage to Tintalous. Mounted on my camel, I
could not help reflecting that we were tormented to
the very doors of the dwelling of En-Noor, that the
people seemed determined we should have no rest
till we arrived there. Afterwards, peradventure,
we may find a little repose; but who can tell?</p>

<p>The rain incommoded us as we advanced.
However, in two hours we arrived at the little village
of Asara, where half-a-dozen inhabitants greeted
us with a stare; and an hour afterwards entered the
broad and spacious valley of Tintalous, firing a
salute as we did so, in compliment to the inhabitants.</p>

<p>We had heard much of the great city of Tintalous;
and I confess that, though accustomed to
desert exaggerations, my mind had dwelt upon this
place so long, that I expected a much more imposing
sight than that which presented itself. This
mighty capital consisted of a mass of houses and
huts, which we calculated to be no more than a<a name="page261" id="page261"></a><span class="pageno">[261]</span>
hundred and fifty in number, situated in the middle
of the valley, with trees here and there interspersed.
It was nothing but a large village. Still, as the
termination of our journey for the present, and its
bearing a name which has been hitherto thrown down
at haphazard anywhere towards the centre of the
southern Sahara, we hailed it with delight. Both
huts and houses wore a truly Soudan character,
and I felt that to a certain extent the object of the
Mission was already accomplished.</p>

<p>Mohammed En-Noor chose us out a good place
for an encampment, upon some sand-hills overlooking
the entire country. When we had pitched
tent, Mr. Yusuf Moknee was despatched to carry
our compliments to the great man of the town,
Sultan En-Noor. This distinguished personage he
found laid up with rheumatism, and unable to receive
us as we desired. However, he expressed a wish to
see Dr. Overweg in his character of medical man,
and made a long harangue to Yusuf, the substance
of which was, that inasmuch as we had come from
Constantinople,<a name="anchor13" id="anchor13"></a><a href="#footnote13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> from Tripoli, from Fezzan, from
Gh&acirc;t, in peace and safety, why should he think of
eating us up and destroying us, like the people of
Taghajeet and others?&mdash;"No; let the Christians
rest in peace. I will now protect them&mdash;let them
not fear. If I had not been ill, I would have come
myself, and fetched them from Taghajeet, and no
one should have touched them. Now, I will take<a name="page262" id="page262"></a><span class="pageno">[262]</span>
them myself to Zinder, or send my sons with them.
They shall be protected on their journey to Bornou
and Soudan."</p>

<p>I shall only observe on this, that I do not think
Sultan En-Noor could have brought us clear through
the countries of Taghajeet and Tidek. We might
have paid something less, but we must have paid.
However, we felt glad on hearing the report of this
speech, and waited patiently for the evening supper
of the great man; but it did not come, to our great
disappointment. The Tanelkums said that this
was a kind of home for them, and that En-Noor
always sent them a supper on the evening of their
arrival. When I saw these good people supperless,
I considered that En-Noor would not give one
supper without the other, and was not prepared for
both.</p>

<p>We felt our case to be rather hard, especially
the Germans; for they had nothing of their own to
eat but dry kuskusou and onions. I was a little
better off. We could get nothing from the town
during the day, not even a fowl or eggs, nor even a
bit of cheese.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we had been told that everything
was abundant in this place. It appears all the
sheep are at a distance, out to graze; as for bullocks,
there are none. Dr. Overweg drew out his bottle
of port wine, and we three Europeans soon made
an end of that, and retired for the night in pretty
good spirits.<a name="page263" id="page263"></a><span class="pageno">[263]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Overweg and Yusuf calculated the number
of people who were reported to be in pursuit of us
from Tajetterat to the Marabouteen, at three hundred
and sixty. The passage of the expedition from
Tajetterat to Tintalous has cost the Government
about one hundred and fifty pounds sterling, at the
least. I cannot get over this. However, let us
raise our hearts in thankfulness to Almighty Providence,
who still watches over us, preserves our
health, and saves us from destruction.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Sept. 4th.</i>&mdash;This morning I sent Yusuf with our recommendations
to En-Noor. He returned in the
best possible humour, repeating that the Sultan was
determined to protect us, and see us safe to Soudan
and Bornou.</p>

<p>A freed black came into my tent, played on his
one-stringed fiddle, and sang an extempore song for
the protection of the Consul. I gave him a handkerchief.
It appears that he is from Tunis.</p>

<p>Yesterday, some specimens of the women of the
lower classes of this town came to our encampment.<a name="page265" id="page265"></a><span class="pageno">[265]</span>
I was astonished to see them such barbarians as to
daub their faces with yellow ochre. I did not expect
this in the Mahommedan country of Aheer. They
had a little ghaseb, a few onions, and other little
things to barter. It is the most difficult thing in
the world to deal with them; and it requires as
long to exchange things of the value of a penny, as
for two London merchants to agree about merchandise
of the value of a hundred thousand pounds!</p>

<p>When I had paid the En-Noor escort, I made a
present to Yusuf and Sa&iuml;d. To the former I gave
a fine burnouse (value thirty-four mahboubs), and
told him I did so as a compensation for the extraordinary
difficulties which we had encountered on
the road from Gh&acirc;t to Aheer, but that I could not
write to Government for a present for him unless
we could make some treaties with the inhabitants
and princes of Central Africa. To Sa&iuml;d I gave a
veneese and a lecture. Our servants have not behaved
so well as they ought to have done, considering that
they are treated so much better than the servants of
Muslims.</p>

<p>Anecdotes of our late adventures are still in circulation
amongst us, and I have learned some new
ones to-day. The <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of one of them is extreme;
but I can do more than allude to it. One of our
party transgressed a custom which the Mahommedans
have absurdly made obligatory. Great indignation
was excited, even amongst the escort sent for
our protection by En-Noor; and one of them exclaimed:<a name="page266" id="page266"></a><span class="pageno">[266]</span>
"If he do the same thing again, and
do not follow the way of us Muslims, I will
send an arrow through him."</p>

<p>During the night of the second affair, Oud-el-Khair
used this nice argument: "What will be
gained if you do kill these three Christians? There
are plenty more in the English country!" Many
topics of a similar character were resorted to.</p>

<p>Some of the Tanelkums leave us to-day. We
have to pay them two reals a camel-load for bringing
us from Tintaghoda to Tintalous. We have
hired of them eleven camels in all. The original
agreement was to carry our goods and baggage
from Mourzuk to Tintaghoda, for which we paid
dear.</p>

<p>Having heard that the great En-Noor would
receive me to-day or to-morrow, as I pleased, I determined
at once to see him, and made ready the
presents for his highness. We had some difficulty
in making the selection. At length we amassed a
variety of things, of the value of one hundred and
twenty-two mahboubs prime cost, or about fifty-two
reals value here.</p>

<p>At the Asar (or 3 P.M.) I dressed, and went off
to see the great man, accompanied by my German
colleagues. On entering the village, I at once recognised
in a long mud-shed the Sultan's palace.
It seemed, indeed, a palace compared with the circular
hasheesh huts by which it was surrounded; and in
that direction, accordingly, we bent our steps. On<a name="page267" id="page267"></a><span class="pageno">[267]</span>
gaining admission, we found the mighty potentate
half-dozing on his couch. He woke up as we entered,
and sitting upon his hams, politely excused
himself for being found <i>en d&eacute;shabille</i>. To remedy
this state of things as much as possible, he immediately
wound round his head a black band or turban;
and having thus improved his toilet, bade us
sit down. I took my place very near him, and
observed his appearance with some interest. He
was a venerable-looking black, but, like most of
the Kailouees, had something of an European cast
of features. They say he is about seventy-eight
years old, and manifestly suffers the infirmities of
that great age.</p>

<p>The dialogue was begun by the Sultan asking us
how we were in health, and whether we had not
now more quiet than down on the road? Then he
added, that he was himself very poorly, but that at
this season of the year this was nothing uncommon.
Being in a garrulous mood, he allowed us little time
to reply, and went on with a string of compliments.
Of the state of his own country he said, "There is
now a general fermentation throughout all the districts
of Aheer. The people have thrown off the
yoke of their sultans or magistrates, and the roads
are infested with bands of robbers." In fact, it
would appear that the inhabitants of this out-of-the
way kingdom have just fallen into the crisis of a
revolution. What grievances brought about this
state of things we have not yet learned; but, unfortunately<a name="page268" id="page268"></a><span class="pageno">[268]</span>
for us, we have arrived at a most insecure
season.</p>

<p>Of the people of his own district the Sultan
said, "You have nothing to fear from them, except
that thieves may come in the night. Beware of
them; and fall upon any one who may come near
your tents after dark. There may be people who
will slink from the neighbouring towns to rob you;
take care and watch during the night." Upon this
I asked him for a couple of servants as guards, but
he replied that it was not necessary.</p>

<p>Of the Tanelkums he observed: "It will be
better when they are gone, for many strangers
come to them, known neither to you nor to me;
and they may rob you." This was an excellent
observation, for on the road I always found that the
Haghar strangers, the bandits, and all the idle, low
characters, who might follow the caravan, never
failed to make friends with our Tanelkums, and
thus gained a footing to carry on their treacherous
designs.</p>

<p>The greater part of the interview was thus occupied
by a little oration on the part of this respectable
Sultan, who wound up by saying that he hoped,
if it pleased God, that we should now enjoy some
repose, and afterwards be conducted safely to Zinder
and Soudan.</p>

<p>Observing that the dialogue was flagging, I
caused the presents we had brought with us to be
laid out. The Sultan examined all the articles<a name="page269" id="page269"></a><span class="pageno">[269]</span>
carefully and quietly, but said not a word. Then
his son-in-law informed us aside that it was now time
to retire. We did so with many compliments, trusting
that our visit had produced a favourable impression.
I was very anxious to know what was
thought of the present,&mdash;the largest we have yet
given, much larger than what was received by
either Hateetah or Wataitee. I sent two of my
servants about to pick up the news in town. I was
not disappointed; I hoped to please his highness,
and succeeded. He was greatly delighted; and,
moreover, displayed immense generosity for an
African. Immediately we had retired he called
together all the great people of the town, and thus
addressed them: "See the fine present these Christians
have brought me. I shall, however, only take
a blue burnouse for myself. The rest I give to
you. Take all else." The notables were greatly
pleased at being called in to share in the gifts, and
exclaimed, "The Consul is a fine man; a man of a
large heart." So far, so good. But some of the
lesser men were heard to say, "Ah! now the
Christians are in peace, and yet they give us nothing.
How much did they give away, and yet get
no rest!" Sure enough; but having been thus
forcedly generous, we had now scarcely anything left
to give. It would require a thousand camel-loads
to satisfy all the tribes and people in this route,
even if their exigencies did not rise in proportion to
our wealth.<a name="page270" id="page270"></a><span class="pageno">[270]</span></p>

<p>We have not yet been able to procure any provisions
in Tintalous. After a journey of two
months, during which we have been obliged to feed
the whole caravan, Kailouees and Tanelkums, to
say nothing of the robbers and bandits, who were
pleased to levy this kind of tribute upon us,
we arrive at a friendly town, and can find nothing
to eat! This is really too bad. Fortunately, I put
away three bottles of olive oil in the spirit-boxes.
With these and my little macaroni I may manage,
perhaps, to subsist until provisions can be
found. But my servants have finished their last
<i>hemsa</i>, and the Germans have nothing left. Our
last resource is our biscuits, which I am sorry we
are obliged to eat in this early part of our journey.
This supply of biscuits has certainly cost us much
in carriage&mdash;many hard dollars; but nevertheless
we have found it excellent for our health, and it now
promises to save us from starvation. We had
heard contradictory reports on the road; some
people saying we should find everything in Aheer,
and others nothing. The latter prophecy seems
likely to turn out true.</p>

<p>There is not much herbage about where we are,
so we are obliged to send away the camels some
distance to feed. It appears to be only the beginning
of the rainy season in Tintalous. We
have passed through much finer districts in Aheer
than this; e.g. that of Taghajeet, where we observed
fat women and fat sheep! But we have not<a name="page271" id="page271"></a><span class="pageno">[271]</span>
yet seen the enormously fat women that Mr. Gagliuffi
described. This, of course, would always be difficult
for us, except in our capacities as physicians. Dr.
Overweg has the best chance of this piece of good
luck.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;We are much troubled with a nephew of
En-Noor, the same that acted as the courier from
Seloufeeat to Tintalous. We gave him a white
burnouse, and he is worrying Yusuf to let him have
a finer and better one. This individual has given
us more trouble than anything else in Tintalous.
Little things here, as elsewhere, prove more annoying
than great things. To set matters straight,
we have offered him a better burnouse, but he is not
yet content.</p>

<p>The Tanelkums are also very troublesome. I
always saw that we must beware of them, for they
will never let us rest, if they can help it, whilst they
are with us. Beg, beg, beg; this alone describes
their conduct towards us.</p>

<p>All the people we have had about us seem to
have considered us their lawful prey, and seek to
gain their ends, if not by violence, at least by continual
importunities: still it must be acknowledged
that the Tanelkums rendered us considerable service
on the road. But, even without this claim, they
would, no doubt, have still pursued the same system
of eternal begging.</p>

<p>This day and yesterday we had thunder, lightning,<a name="page272" id="page272"></a><span class="pageno">[272]</span>
and much rain. The sky was covered with
clouds, yet the thermometer rose at half-past three
in the afternoon to 82&deg; in our tent. I walked a
little before the tent early this morning, to keep
up my bodily vigour. I had a little internal pain
yesterday. If I suffer in Africa from disease, it
will most probably be from dysentery. God grant
that I may escape, and be grateful for his mercy!</p>

<p>Sultan En-Noor yesterday observed, respecting
the passage of Christians through these countries,
"that after a short time the feelings of the people
would subside, and nothing more be thought of us."
This may be; but it will require the passage of
many Christians before the tendency to fanaticism
is sufficiently curbed to render the road safe for
them.</p>

<p>I mentioned in my diary at Mourzuk, that
one of our blacks had exercised the privilege of
divorce with respect to his wife. This lady did not
leave the caravan, but has since passed from tent
to tent, as the caprice of fortune carried her.
She was first taken up by Sakonteroua; then by
En-Noor, our Kailouee guide; and afterwards by
some other person. Yesterday I saw her in the
tent of the Sfaxee. The poor woman submits to
the inconstancy of Fortune with marvellous fortitude.
She is now quite merry, and inclined to play the
coquette. Poor thing! Let us be thankful for her
that she has been granted this elasticity of temper,<a name="page273" id="page273"></a><span class="pageno">[273]</span>
and that she is willing to the last to cheer
gloom of whomsoever will be cheered in return for
a little tenderness and protection.</p>

<p>I insert a note upon the money used here:</p>

<table summary="money">
<tr><td>The large dollar (douro)</td><td></td><td>7 Tunisian piastres.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The small dollar</td><td></td><td>5 Tun. piast. (in Mourzuk).</td></tr>
<tr><td>The large dollar</td><td></td><td>3 metagals.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The small dollar</td><td></td><td>2 metagals (in Tintalous).</td></tr>
<tr><td>One metagal</td><td></td><td>1000 wadas (in Tintalous).</td></tr>
<tr><td>One mahboub</td><td></td><td>7 Tun. piast. (60 paras in Mourzuk and Tripoli).</td></tr>
<tr><td>One metagal</td><td></td><td>40 dr&acirc;a<a name="anchor14" id="anchor14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a> (in Aheer and Soudan).</td></tr>
</table>

<p>I was engaged in setting down this information,
when intelligence was brought me that our camels
had again been carried off. This affront was offered
us yesterday at noon, during a storm of rain, before
my visit to the Sultan; but Yusuf had thought it
best to keep the matter concealed from me, hoping
restitution would be made before I heard of it. I
sent him immediately to lay our case before the
Sultan. So it seems that we are to be hunted here,
even, in our repose under the protection of En-Noor!
It is impossible to tell how we shall get safely to
Zinder. Our boat is still at Seloufeeat. Yusuf is
gone to see En-Noor.</p>

<p>Naturally I feel very much annoyed about the
missing camels. They were stolen, it seems, not only
in the middle of the day, but at a distance of not
more than a quarter of a mile from the residence of<a name="page274" id="page274"></a><span class="pageno">[274]</span>
En-Noor! This is too bad, really too bad. Are
we never to have any repose?</p>

<p>In the evening, as a slight consolation, we were
fortunate enough to purchase some provisions. The
German got two goats, and I some samen. I also
borrowed ghaseb until we could buy.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;I got up in better health this morning,
and felt the benefit of the goats'-flesh broth. I
observe that it does not rain during the night; the
showers come on generally in the afternoon. The
mornings are dry, fine, and hot. This morning,
at half-past seven A.M., the thermometer stood
under the tent at 79&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>The Tanelkums, by the way, left us yesterday
evening. They all return in the course of
fifteen days; some of them go on to Zinder, and
others make their way back to Mourzuk. Haj
Omer quarrelled desperately with Yusuf before he
started.</p>

<p>I may here make a few observations on these
curious people. Generally, the Tanelkums are
reckoned amongst the most effeminate and civilised
of the Tuaricks of the north; and, indeed, such
appears to be their character, as developed in our
transactions with them. Some of them have more
the manners of merchants than camel-drivers; and
the mercantile character always tames men in the
desert. Throughout their journey with us they
were at all times polite, and at last even became
quite amiable. During the two affairs which we<a name="page275" id="page275"></a><span class="pageno">[275]</span>
had with the robbers, their conduct was regular and
brave: once or twice only they seemed to waver.
But probably, had their own interests been imminently
exposed, they would have abandoned us to
save themselves, at which we should not have been
surprised. Had there been a regular battle, in
which they had taken part, the road would certainly
have been closed to them ever afterwards.</p>

<p>Like all Tuaricks, these Tanelkums are great
beggars, and such of them as were with us allowed
no opportunity to escape of getting something out
of us. They are always accompanied by a few
Haghars or Azghers. In features they are for the
most part European; a few only are marked by
negro characters; but nearly all are very dark
in complexion. They are generally good-looking,
tall, and slightly made. Their manners are quite
Tuarick, and they speak a regular Tuarick dialect.
They also speak a little Arabic, and understand the
Hausa. As to religion, they are very devout and
superstitious, and remain long at their prayers.</p>

<p>The huckster-women of the town continue to
visit us, bringing their small wares. Many of them
have their faces painted very picturesquely with
green and yellow. They are mere negroes in features.
These women bring very small quantities of
the dark-brown rice of Soudan, with ghaseb, onions,
and other little things.</p>

<p>I find that our servants are to-day in better
spirits, because we have got a supply of provisions.<a name="page276" id="page276"></a><span class="pageno">[276]</span>
I repeat again, that the Germans and myself enjoy
tolerably good health, but none of us can be said to
be in a state of robust bodily vigour.</p>

<p>This portion of the landscape of Aheer, if I may
use the term landscape, does not differ materially
from the first which we entered. The rocks are all
granite, and of one colour.</p>

<p>The greater part of the trees are tholukh and
souak. The hasheesh consists chiefly of the <i>bou
rekabah</i>.</p>

<p>In the valley I observe a fine old specimen of
the Soudan tree, called, in Bornouese, <i>k&#259;r&aacute;ghou</i>.
The little black-and-white bird which has followed
us all through the desert from Mourzuk still
appears here, and sings a little.</p>

<p>It is difficult to describe the state of mind in which
I write down all these things. Here we are helplessly
encamped, our camels driven away, and no
signs of their return. Certainly En-Noor sends us
promises that he will do what he can for us; but
though we do not doubt his goodwill we begin to be
uncertain of his power. He is still suffering from
rheumatism and fever, and they tell us he is not
able to receive strangers. Let us hope that this
seclusion bodes no ill to our interests. Some of his
female relations came this morning to ask for little
presents. I gave the mother of Mohammed, who
commanded our escort, a handkerchief. This young
man has, we are told, gone out this morning alone to
search for our lost camels. Meanwhile, in the hope<a name="page277" id="page277"></a><span class="pageno">[277]</span>
that our property may be restored to us, I propose
to write to Zinder for an escort. It is better and
more agreeable to pay escorts than robbers in these
countries. But I must wait for the recovery of En-Noor.
They tell us now that there are no robbers
or bandits along the Soudan route at all; and the
proof cited is, that the smallest caravans pass in
safety. The property of Christians, however, will
probably be considered as common property, the
lawful prey of every one who may be disposed to
possess himself of it. This news of peace, therefore,
concerns us not. We may still have to buy our
way.</p>

<p>The thermometer under the tent this evening, at
an hour after dark, was 81&deg; Fahrenheit.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;I rose late, after a more refreshing sleep
than usual, and felt much better in health. The
sky was overcast with thick clouds; and the thermometer
stood at 77&deg; at seven A.M. My first question
was, whether any news had been heard of the camels;
but I only learned that on the previous day many
people had gone in search of them, scouring the
country. The servants notice that I am much
depressed, and endeavour to cheer me. On the
whole I must say that they show considerable good
feeling.</p>

<p>I remember now with pleasure, that when we
were attacked on the road and I appeared with arms
amongst them, they always insisted upon my going
to my tent, exclaiming: "Go, O Consul, to your tent;<a name="page278" id="page278"></a><span class="pageno">[278]</span>
rest there: you shall not fight." Some added: "Let
them kill us first; then you may fight if you please:
but whilst we are living remain in your tent!"
These were not mere words, but expressed sympathy
and fidelity. I ought to mention, that all along this
journey I went among the people by the name of
Consul Yak&#333;b, whilst Dr. Barth was known as the
Reis, and Dr. Overweg as the Taleb.</p>

<p>On this occasion these poor fellows threw words
of consolation to me in the midst of their bartering
for provisions, which at the present moment was
their greatest care, if I except that of eating them.
They have been living on short commons, and have
suffered as much as we have. Want of regular food
may have had an effect on me. I find that my
hopes of good health are to be disappointed. I am
obliged to keep my bed this afternoon, and to refrain
from nourishment. Meanwhile a storm again comes
on, laden with sand, which covers everything. Then
follows violent rain, which lasts until late in the
evening.</p>

<p>As I lay, troubling myself with apprehension of
the Kailouees, En-Noor of our escort came to pay
us a visit. He says he has been to his own town,
and promises us better fortune higher up towards
Soudan than we have hitherto had. He is himself
about to start with a large caravan for Zinder, in
about twenty days. Among other news, he tells us
of the progress of the insurrection. The tribes
passed some distance to our right a few days ago,<a name="page279" id="page279"></a><span class="pageno">[279]</span>
moving towards Asoudee and Aghadez, to instal a
new Sultan. The revolution is now at its height,
but may soon be brought to a close. It is fortunate
that Tintalous lay out of the way of these rude
desert revolutionists, as a visit from them might
have been attended with evil consequence to us.</p>

<p>The excitement caused by this intelligence was a
little calmed by the report that our camels had been
heard of in the direction of Aghazar. Our friend
Mohammed is in full pursuit of them, with fair hopes
of procuring their return. En-Noor says that we
shall certainly get them back,&mdash;all; but he adds the
qualifying phrase, <i>Inshallah!</i>&mdash;if it please God!
Meanwhile "patience," as my comforter advises me.
He is quite a narrative man, and enlarges on geography.
According to him, Asben is the Soudan
name for all this country, whilst it is known as
Aheer by the people of the north.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>&mdash;I felt much better this morning, having
got rid of the diarrhoea. The weather was very
damp, and the thermometer at six A.M. stood at
72&deg;. At one o'clock it rose to 90&deg;, but still there
was cool air flying about the tent. The sky remained
overcast all day, but birds were singing as
if it were the opening of the Aheer spring.</p>

<p>Dr. Overweg remarks truly, that you cannot
shoot a man in this country, even if he knocks you
down and robs you; for that would be the murder
by an infidel of a Muslim, and the whole population
would rise up against you. The observation may<a name="page280" id="page280"></a><span class="pageno">[280]</span>
become a practical one of these days; and submission
will prove to be the only remedy, whatever
may happen.</p>

<p>Another result of practical observation! We shall
have to destroy our tin biscuit-chests, for all the
people swear that they are full of money. Our own servants
go so far as to say that these chests, by exciting
the curiosity and cupidity of the people, have been
the causes of most of our misfortunes. In whatever
case, every European travelling through these countries
will be considered to have half his baggage
consisting of gold and silver. I have been telling
the people all along I have not any money, but no
one quite believes me.</p>

<p>In this country, by the way, and all Saharan
countries where many languages are spoken, a
great deal is done by signs. The sign of the
crooked forefinger represents the crouching of man
and beast under sickness; but no sign is more common
than which represents the large Spanish dollar,
namely, forming a circle with the thumb and forefinger,
and turning the thumb downwards.</p>

<p>Escort En-Noor, as I am obliged to distinguish
him, returns to his place this night, and takes with
him three or four camels, to give them something to
eat; they are starving here near the town. I settled
with him for the thirty-seven reals of Wataitee in
goods, not money;&mdash;so the Queen's property goes!</p>

<p>The peculiarity of this locality at the present
season of the year appears to be, that it rains every<a name="page281" id="page281"></a><span class="pageno">[281]</span>
afternoon, beginning about three P.M.; the showers
being preceded by a few puffs of strong wind, and
continuing till an hour before dark. This is fortunate
for us, for we know how to prepare ourselves
for circumstances. Under tent we have a most
drenching dampness during the night, continuing
till the sun gets well up next morning. The people
say that the rain has given over in Soudan. The
season is, therefore, later here. The rain, if I may
use the expression, would seem now to travel north;
it has, however, began up in the higher regions surrounding
Constantine. When I was there, I believe
in August 1846, it had already set in; and
now it will soon begin in Tripoli. At nine A.M. we
begin to dry our clothes, and we get pretty well
dried and aired by the time the rain begins again in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday a woman died in Tintalous,
and was carried to the grave solely by women.
This was considered an extraordinary thing by the
Moors of the coast, but I see nothing extraordinary
in the circumstance. The fact is, the Moors
think the men ought to do everything except bear
children and perform the drudgery of the household.</p>

<p>We have little communication with the town,
the rain cutting us off from it and its inhabitants. A
flood of water pours down the valley every evening,
after which the ground continues all night and all
next day in a state of wet mud.<a name="page282" id="page282"></a><span class="pageno">[282]</span></p>

<p><i>9th.</i>&mdash;I rose without receiving any good news.
On the contrary, Mr. Sfaxee, who has always professed
such disinterestedness, begins to hint demands.
I find that I shall have to pay him as much as the
other people. Escort En-Noor, by the way, was
delighted with the little present I made to him of a
pair of coloured scissors for his wife. The thermometer
a little after mid-day rose to 94&deg; Fahr. and
27&deg; 30' of R&eacute;aum. In the afternoon the rain only
threatened, and we had but two or three puffs of
wind.</p>

<p>We hear that the Sultan is better; and from his
servants we collect that he is not willing we should
go on to Zinder unless escorted by himself. Certainly
this arrangement would please us under ordinary
circumstances; but we hear that it would detain
us two or three months in Aheer, which will
never do. To-day I made acquaintance with the
round salt-cakes of Bilma. They consist of a very
rough species of salt, like so many big round grains
of the coarsest sandstone. One that I saw was of a
dark brown colour, extremely dirty, about half-a-foot
in diameter. Apparently these lumps are very
compact; they serve as money both in Soudan and
Tintalous. The greater part of the revenue of
Aheer is derived from this salt carrying between
Bilma and Zinder.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>&mdash;This morning I felt much better, as well
as I have ever done since leaving Tripoli. One
adapts one's self to any climate by degrees. I took<a name="page283" id="page283"></a><span class="pageno">[283]</span>
courage even to read a little, and went over Jackson's
"What to Observe," among other things. But
my mind is still troubled about our future course of
proceeding. It is impossible to bring Sultan En-Noor
to any arrangement. He still shelters himself
from our importunities under the plea of ill health.
Almost every morning we have a few visitors from
the town. The people are not troublesome, except
that they show a good deal of prying curiosity to see
the faces, forms, and actions of Christians. We
learn that scouts are still out after our camels,
hitherto without success. I am afraid they have
been driven far away; and begin to doubt our ever
setting eyes on them again.</p>

<p>The morning was clear and dry, with a little
cool wind breathing up the valley. The country
was covered with fresh herbage; trees were budding
and birds singing, as in spring. Yesterday evening
we had a visit from a wolf, who was looking out for
our two or three sheep for a supper, but the watch
was too well kept. There are many wild animals in
Aheer, but we have hitherto seen but few. Very
pretty doves fly about our tent; and Dr. Overweg
shot some small birds to send home.</p>

<p>Aheer, in general, must be considered as a part
of the Southern Sahara, or Great Desert. Any
country not producing periodic crops of grain,
either by the annual rains or by irrigation, comes
under this denomination here. Aheer answers the
description perfectly, although there are some exceptions.<a name="page284" id="page284"></a><span class="pageno">[284]</span>
Seloufeeat and Tintaghoda have annual
crops of grain produced by irrigation.</p>

<p>I have obtained a list, such as it is, of the towns
and villages surrounding Tintalous. Seloufeeat and
Tintaghoda are not mentioned, as they lay in our
route to this place. My informant declined to give
any account of the numbers of the population, in all
cases.<a name="anchor15" id="anchor15"></a><a href="#footnote15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>From Tintalous, as radii, are spread around the
towns and villages of&mdash;As&#259;r&aacute;, two hours west; As&#259;r&#259;r&aacute;,
a place near Asoudee; Gh&#259;loulaf, four hours
south; Asoudee, six hours south-south-west; T&#259;nous&#259;m&#259;t,

and many dates); Doumous, one day west; Agharghar,
two days west; Oud&#259;ras, two days south-south-west
(place for shepherds); Abasas, two days south
(a place for shepherds); Tabernee (a well), two days<a name="page285" id="page285"></a><span class="pageno">[285]</span>
south; Shouw&#259;r&#275;k&#275;d&#275;, or Touwerkedad (on the
side of Tabernee), one day south; Maree, one day
south (place for shepherds); Ar&#259;s&#257;mad&#259;n, by the
side of Maree, south (well); Shintaghalee, in Wady
Tentaghemea, near the above, south; Azanwazgh&#275;r,
near the above, south; Zanairas,<a name="anchor16" id="anchor16"></a><a href="#footnote16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> two days north-east.</p>

<p>It would have been very interesting to collect
authentic information as to the population of many
places in Aheer. I suspect the number of inhabitants
is very small indeed. I had already been
powerfully impressed with the paucity of the population
of the districts of Gh&acirc;t, the desert region
occupied by the Azgher, and had been led to compute
that they cannot contain in all more than a
couple of thousand people.</p>

in many cases. [At the end of the volume will be found more complete

<p><i>10th Sept. continued.</i>&mdash;Yusuf has been to the town,
but has come back without any authentic news
of the departure of the caravans for Zinder. He
says, however, that En-Noor is better; and that
it is reported that the first caravan will go in fifteen
or twenty days, and the second and largest,
with which En-Noor himself talks of setting out,
about twenty days afterwards.</p>

<p>I was disturbed this evening from my repose on
the dry sand under the pale moonlight by the most
unearthly noises, coming from a group of our black
servants. On getting up to see what it was, I found<a name="page287" id="page287"></a><span class="pageno">[287]</span>
that one of our negresses, a wife of one of the servants,
was performing <i>Boree</i>, the "Devil," and
working herself up into the belief that his Satanic
majesty had possession of her. She threw herself
upon the ground in all directions, and imitated the
cries of various animals. Her actions were, however,
somewhat regulated by a man tapping upon
a kettle with a piece of wood, beating time to her
wild manoeuvres. After some delay, believing herself
now possessed, and capable of performing her
work, she went forward to half-a-dozen, of our servants,
who were squatting down, on their hams,
ready to receive her. She then took each by the
head and neck, and pressed their heads between her
legs&mdash;they sitting, she standing&mdash;not in the most
decent way, and made over them, with her whole
body, certain inelegant motions, not to be mentioned.
She then put their hands and arms behind their
backs, and after several other wild cries and jumps,
and having for a moment thrown herself flat upon
the ground, she declared to each and all <i>their future</i>&mdash;their
fortune, good or bad. I did not stop to see
the result of the ceremony. The slaves carry these
mysteries with them in their servitude, and the
practice of such indecent and profane things
tolerated by the Muslims of the coast. The Moors
and Arabs, indeed, have great faith in these mysteries,
and resort to them to know <i>their future</i>.</p>

<p>I made this day a list of objects of barter:&mdash;A
looking-glass in a tin case, value, in Tripoli,<a name="page288" id="page288"></a><span class="pageno">[288]</span>
thirty paras, purchases here two sahs of ghaseb.
A common print handkerchief, value fourpence
English money, only purchases three or four sahs
of ghaseb.</p>

<p>Eight dr&acirc;a of fine white calico are equal to one
metagal; three of which metagals is a large dollar.
(This does not sell at much advantage.)</p>

<p>I this day finished my dispatch, dated from
Esalan, respecting the disputes and disagreements
I had with the Tuaricks of Gh&acirc;t; but since then
these Haghars have, indeed, appeared very moderate
people to us.</p>

<p>Thermometer at half-past twelve P.M., under
tent, 92&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>Instead of much rain, we have had a squall of
wind this afternoon, attended by a slight shower.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Yusuf came, with a menacing
tone, from En-Noor, saying, we must pay ten metagals
(of this country) for finding each of the lost
camels; or if not, this sum would be taken from us
by force. Yusuf added, also, that En-Noor was
dissatisfied with his present; that the Sultan had
remarked to him,&mdash;"It was a present for servants,
and he had given it all away to the people." Moreover,
that yesterday came several persons, marabouts,
from Tintaghoda, who mentioned their displeasure
to En-Noor because they had not yet
received anything.</p>

<p>I was just rejoicing at the finding of three lost
camels; but it seems we are not to have a moment<a name="page289" id="page289"></a><span class="pageno">[289]</span>
of repose or enjoyment in Aheer. It may be, hereafter,
"sweet to remember these things," but it is
now a sad trial of patience to bear them. I abused
En-Noor and our servants in turn. As to the forty
metagals, there was not a question ventured about
that; but the present of En-Noor was the largest
we had ever made, and it would have been better to
have brought with us letters of recommendation for
robbers than such people. All this comes after it
had been noised abroad through the whole village
that En-Noor was greatly rejoiced at the present,
and all the people were happy and content. Such,
however, is the dependence to be placed on reports
in the African kingdom of Aheer! However, I am
determined to give way to no more vain fears, but
to preserve as much as possible of the property of
Government. I am sorry to say that I receive no
assistance in my efforts to save the money with
which I have been entrusted.</p>

<p>I am now writing to Mr. Gagliuffi on the subject
of the great losses and shameless extortion to
which we were subjected on our arrival in this
country. In reviewing the whole affair, setting
apart the personal devotion exhibited towards myself,
I have no cause to be pleased with our escort
and servants. They gave way too easily to fear, and,
seem to have been too willing to allow us to buy
ourselves off. I have omitted to mention that they
wished us to write a document, to the effect that if
we came to harm it was not through their fault!<a name="page290" id="page290"></a><span class="pageno">[290]</span>
This singular idea was, of course, rejected. I must
observe, that not only we, but all our caravan, were
prodigiously disappointed by the reception we met
with. The Haghars were expected to be troublesome,
and their alleged pursuit of us was sufficiently
probable; but no one admitted that there was any
danger from the people of Aheer. On the contrary,
all professed delight at the prospect of entering the
inhabited districts, where it was thought and boldly
proclaimed we should all have the most cordial
welcome. Yet the Haghars did not come, and
the borderers of Aheer treated us as badly as the
wildest Tuaricks could have done, behaving like
veritable brigands. I entertain some faint hopes
of obtaining redress; but have been so often deceived,
that I shall say nothing for the present on
the subject.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 13th Sept.</i>&mdash;I rose early; a fine morning.
Thermometer at a quarter to seven P.M. under
tent, 78&deg;. We had a visit early from the son-in-law
of En-Noor and his two friends, who had found the
camels. They were extremely polite, and much
pleased when I sent them to the Sfaxee to receive
forty metagals for the recovery of the four lost
camels (one is not yet come up). Then I had a visit
from one of the slaves of En-Noor's brother. This
man gave a good account of En-Noor, and said he
would certainly go with us. He observed, also,
respecting the Sultan's authority, "En-Noor governs
everywhere&mdash;all Aheer, and even Damerghou<a name="page291" id="page291"></a><span class="pageno">[291]</span>
and Zinder." This must be taken to signify, En-Noor
has great influence in all these countries.</p>

<p>Asoudee is said by some to be a city, walled,
and of considerable extent, with many people; others
represent it as being in ruins. I think its ruins are
mentioned in my Ghadamez itinerary. Unlike
Tintalous, a great quantity of provisions is stored
up in that place.</p>

<p>Yusuf and the Sfaxee came this morning from
En-Noor, and brought more tranquillising news;
but we have been obliged to give ten douros each
for finding the lost camels&mdash;almost as much as my
white maharee is worth. However, I remained in
tolerably good spirits all day, cheered by the favourable
account given me of the Sultan. But woe to
the man who hugs himself in a feeling of security
in Aheer!</p>

<p>Late in the evening Yusuf and the Sfaxee came
from En-Noor with a most threatening message.
The Sheikh says, in substance, that "Everybody
wishes to attack us, and take away our property.
To protect us, therefore, and conduct us to Zinder,
he must have, at least, seven hundred dollars." At
first he demanded one thousand, and then came
down to seven hundred. Such is the man to whom
we are recommended as a friend and protector.
None of the robbers have yet taken so large a sum,
so that this is the greatest, grandest of the brigands!
I went to bed disquieted by the enormity of En-Noor's
demands.<a name="page292" id="page292"></a><span class="pageno">[292]</span></p>

<p><i>14th.</i>&mdash;As may be imagined, I passed an unquiet
night, disturbed by the most gloomy forebodings.
It now appeared to me that all the amenity of the
Sultan had been assumed, in order that he might
first get all he could out of us by gentle means, previous
to resorting to threats and bullying. As to
resistance, it is, of course, impossible, if imperative
demands be made. In the morning En-Noor sent
a message, to the effect that he could not see us unless
we had made up our minds to give him the
seven hundred dollars. He is getting more and
more bold and impertinent. I deputed Mahommed
Tunisee and the Sfaxee to him as negotiators.
They are to offer a present of five hundred dollars;
that is to say, three hundred for the escort to Zinder,
and the remaining two hundred after the signing
of the treaty. With some difficulty the matter
was for the present arranged, by the sacrifice of
another hundred dollars as a present to the courtiers
of the great man, in order that they might induce
him to be so kind as to accept of the remaining
five hundred! My agents were greatly assisted by
the Wakeel of Makersee of Mourzuk. I consented
to the arrangement on En-Noor's writing a letter to
her Majesty's Government, promising protection to
British travellers for the future; and thus ended this
new, and I may say, flagrant series of exactions. Possibly,
had I been alone, I might have been able to
hold out longer and more successfully; but it is
somewhat embarrassing to act with persons who<a name="page293" id="page293"></a><span class="pageno">[293]</span>
share in your councils without sharing in your
responsibility, and who naturally seek the shortest
and easiest method of getting over all difficulties.
The conclusion of the arrangement had a tranquillising
effect upon our encampment, especially on
my worthy German colleagues.</p>

<p>The people have complained to En-Noor that we
are "writing the country." This is an old complaint,
and pervades all Northern Africa and the Desert,
"that the Christians come first to write a country,
and afterwards invade or capture it." Travellers,
therefore, especially when they venture to use the
pen in public, are looked upon as spies, which may
in part account for the rough treatment they sometimes
receive.</p>

<p>Every place has certain things especially in
demand. Here nothing goes down but white calico
and very small looking-glasses, which shut up in
boxes. With these we purchase the greater part
of our provisions. There is a little cotton-money
about. Our encampment sometimes resembles a
market. The people are curious to observe every
action which differs from theirs. When I promenade
a little for exercise, they immediately turn
their eyes upon me with astonishment, and some
come to ask what I do that for. I reply by signs,<a name="anchor17" id="anchor17"></a><a href="#footnote17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
feeling my legs and stretching them. This proves<a name="page294" id="page294"></a><span class="pageno">[294]</span>
satisfactory, for the Kailouees are apparently an
active people, at least in this season; but they
moved about little while the rain lasted, and in
the middle of the day they rarely visit us&mdash;always
in the morning and in the afternoon. Dr. Overweg
has got some patients; but people generally seem
to enjoy very good health in this place. We have
now a great deal of wind instead of rain: it always
blows hard in the latter part of the day. I find
this weather very bracing, though the thermometer
at nine P.M. sometimes stands at 83&deg;. The rainy
season may be considered nearly at an end.</p>

<p>The valleys and rocks of Aheer abound with
several kinds of wild animals, both the inoffensive
and the ferocious; viz. the gazelle, the wadan, the
wild ox, the ostrich, the wild boar, the jackal, the wolf,
the hy&aelig;na, and the lion. Numerous birds haunt
the trees. Amongst others we noticed a very beautiful
species of dove, with a very distinct black ring
round its neck; the hippoo; the wood-pecker;
linnets; and over us flew the little black-and-white
bird with the long feathers in its tail.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>&mdash;We had a fine morning; the wind has
quite dried our encampment. There will be little
more wet weather, they tell us; and the rain has some
time quite ceased in Soudan. This is fortunate, as
already several of our things have been spoiled.
The Kailouees are taking advantage of the dry
weather, and may be seen riding about in all
directions. The members of the great families, like<a name="page295" id="page295"></a><span class="pageno">[295]</span>
our European aristocrats, seem to have no other
occupation. God has created the earth for this
class to gallop about over. It was very warm and
fine all day; thermometer at noon, in tent, 95&deg; Fahr.:
there was little wind.</p>

<p>The secret of En-Noor's authority is this: in
all his great gains, and lucky enterprises, and pieces
of good fortune&mdash;as our arrival here has proved&mdash;he
gives his principal people and courtiers a share
of the profit or the spoil; and when nothing particular
is going on, he feeds them from the granary
of his house, or clothes them from his heaped-up
merchandise. All this, however does not save the
prince from being occasionally robbed&mdash;if we are to
believe report, which says that the other evening
some black cotton turbans were taken from his house.
The news from the town is, that En-Noor and his
courtiers have received the amount of their extortion
in goods. We have now given at Tintalous to the
value of nearly a thousand dollars, and yet we have
not received the smallest present in return&mdash;not a
supper the day of our arrival, not a little butter or
fruit; nothing, absolutely nothing!</p>

<p>Our servants have nearly procured all the ghaseb
which they require for the journey from this to
Zinder, viz. one hundred sahs. This they have purchased
with various little wares, principally knives
and looking-glasses. The ghaseb is always mixed
with ghafouley, a species of grain about a third the
size of a small pea. Ghafouley is called <i>koula</i> in<a name="page296" id="page296"></a><span class="pageno">[296]</span>
Soudanese. The Aheer cheese has appeared for the
first time amongst us to-day. It is made in little
squares, three by two inches broad, and a quarter
of an inch thick. It is eaten fresh, but has a poor
flavour. The people prefer pounding it into dust
when dry, and drinking it with ghaseb-water,
which is white as milk, and very cool. The paste
thus made is very white, and becomes as hard as a
stone when dry. I have also made acquaintance
with <i>doua doua</i>, round black balls of a vegetable
composition, eaten with various dishes as seasoning.
It is very abundant in Soudan. There is also a
species of ghaseb-paste, called <i>d&#257;b&oacute;&#259;</i>, not unlike
macaroni in very small pieces. This is very much
esteemed. It swells exceedingly when boiled, like
paste. We begin to get into regions where the
preparation of food is greatly changing. Yesterday
my servants purchased me a fowl, and I learned for
the first time that this delicacy was to be procured.</p>

<p>I have studied but little since I left Tripoli.
Our affairs have always been worse and worse, and
we have had a continual battle to preserve our
existence. Such is the beginning of this expedition:
God only knows what may be its <i>end</i>. There
is left for us but a firm reliance in His goodness and
protecting providence.</p>

<p><i>16th.</i>&mdash;This was a warm, hazy day, and we were
troubled with considerable languor. I have slept
but little these three nights, and feel somewhat
indisposed for want of rest. I read a good deal of<a name="page297" id="page297"></a><span class="pageno">[297]</span>
Clapperton's "Journey to Sakkatou," besides beginning
a vocabulary of the Kailouee language, with
the assistance of Mokhlak Bou Yeldee, who is a
very clever young man. He gets his living by
writing charms, and sells a good number for the
cure of disease. People pour water on the ink or
writing of the charm, and then drink the magic
liquid. The remedy is doubtless as effectual as
many patent medicines in Europe. As is well
known, this superstition of drinking the Koran is of
old date.</p>

<p>En-Noor sent a message this morning by the
slave of Makersee, that we were not to say a single
word to any one, not even to our servants, about the
money, or its amount, which we have paid him for
our escort to Zinder. He says, "If the people hear
of this money, they will all come down upon me for
a portion; and if I do not comply with their wishes
they will abandon us, and not go with us to Zinder,
and I want as many of them to go with me as
possible."</p>

<p>Our wealth is still noised abroad! The people
believe all our boxes to be full of gold and silver.
Even En-Noor sought for secret information respecting
the amount of dollars which he supposed to be
concealed amongst our baggage.</p>

<p>I was again restless when night came on, and
was still awake when the moon was near setting,
about three A.M., under tent, at which time suddenly
I heard the wife of Sa&iuml;d begin to squall, with the<a name="page298" id="page298"></a><span class="pageno">[298]</span>
sound of the trampling of feet around my tent. I
conjectured immediately what was up, "Another
attack!" I repeated mechanically to myself, and
getting up, began to dress myself. At first I
thought our assailants were at some distance off,
but when the boxes began to be drawn from around
my tent I exclaimed, "Oh, oh, they are upon me,
and are carrying off the things." Still I had become
so accustomed to these attacks, or attempted attacks,
by night and by day, that I felt quite indifferent,
and began to dress myself as if nothing was the
matter, or simply as if some one had called me up
suddenly to breakfast, or that we were to start off
early on our way.</p>

<p>I found my clothes, however, with some difficulty,
and tore them a little in putting them on. At
last I went out. All our people were up, as well as
the Germans. On inquiring the news, I learned
that a band of robbers had attacked us; from six
to ten had been counted. My servants had all
decamped, with the exception of Sa&iuml;d. Some of
them had been struck by the robbers, and others
had been threatened, and had ran away. My servant
Sa&iuml;d, as soon as he sallied out and saw what
was going on, seized his matchlock, and pointed it
at the assailants, especially those who were removing
the saharees (large square boxes). Upon this they
began to quake, and, parleying with Sa&iuml;d, begged
for mercy, and said they would go immediately if
the powder was not used against them. Sa&iuml;d took<a name="page299" id="page299"></a><span class="pageno">[299]</span>
them at their word, and they ran off. They had
already, however, carried away about nine pounds
of tea, packed in tin boxes. It is probable they
mistook these boxes of tin for silver, or considered
their contents to be money, gold and silver, although
their lightness should have undeceived them. As
the Arabic Bibles and Testaments were packed up
with the tea, they carried off a Bible with them.
But this they afterwards dropped on the road, and
it was picked up by a shepherdess, and brought to
me. They also took away a pewter dish and two
bags of grounded ghaseb, besides ripping open the
bags of the blacks. This appears to be the amount
of the robbery and devastation; very fortunate are
we it was not worse. We had watched many nights,
and had often loaded our guns; but this night, when
the thieves came, we were miserably unprepared to
receive them. The Germans had been cleaning
their guns, and all were unloaded. Overweg had
his fowling-piece charged with small shot. At length
we got two or three guns in trim, and our servants
followed the robbers, but nothing of them was to be
seen. The cowards had fled at the first show of
resistance. In the morning, on searching through
the small valley up which they had come, we were
surprised to find marks of no less than thirteen
camels&mdash;enough to carry away all our goods. So
that it is probable there were some thirteen robbers,
a part of whom remained with the camels whilst the
others attacked us. Amankee, on being knocked<a name="page300" id="page300"></a><span class="pageno">[300]</span>
down with a shield, got up again, and ran off to the
town, giving the alarm everywhere.</p>

<p>En-Noor, as soon as the news of this aggression
reached him, sent off a <i>posse</i> of people, and then
called in the inhabitants of a neighbouring village;
so that, when all was over, our encampment was
surrounded by a disorderly multitude of protectors
till daylight.</p>

<p>To my tent came the confidential servant of
En-Noor, and everybody was talking, drinking
coffee, and making merry. After all, it was well to
have these people, for if the thirteen robbers had
shown ordinary courage, in our unprepared state we
should have had a good deal of work to do, and
might some of us have got bad sword-cuts or spear-thrusts.</p>

<p>En-Noor, they say, is exceedingly angry about
this attack, and has sent eleven mounted men after
the robbers to seize their camels, which if he gets
hold of he intends to confiscate. On Amankee
calling on him he observed, "You, Amankee, being
a native of Soudan, and not a Muslim of Tripoli, are
like the Kailouees. You can fire on these Kailouee
robbers. Get your gun loaded, ready for any other
occasion."</p>

<p>At daylight, after lecturing my servants for not
giving the alarm (for, with the exception of Sa&iuml;d's
wife, they were all so terror-stricken&mdash;literally
struck dumb with terror&mdash;that they could not
speak, much-less cry out), I sent Amankee off at<a name="page301" id="page301"></a><span class="pageno">[301]</span>
the heels of the robbers. In all such emergencies
I have found no one like Amankee; he is a complete
bloodhound, and can scent his way through all the
desert, and follow the steps of the most agile and
quick-witted fugitive. I knew Amankee would
pick up some of the tea and bring news of the
robbers. He returned, and fulfilled my expectations:
he picked up about six ounces of tea scattered on
the road, and brought the news that the robbers
were from Tidek and Taghajeet. They had come
some days' journey to plunder us. I learned, also,
that the rascals, just before they attacked us, had
been feasting at a wedding in Tintalous.</p>

<p>I grieved very much for the loss of my tea, and
employed six or seven hours in picking the stones
out of what Amankee recovered. I had greatly
coveted this luxury, and set my heart upon it; and
now my idol was ruthlessly torn from me by a band
of robbers! Amankee, knowing my feelings, had
offered a reward for the rest, telling the people he
saw on the road that the tea could only be drank by
Christians, and was poison for Muslims! This fib
drew from the astonished Kailouees a woful ejaculation&mdash;"Allah!
Allah!" Many funny scenes were
enacted during the few minutes of the attack of the
robbers. The other negress, a wife of another of
the servants, was quite dumb; but Sa&iuml;d's wife crept
around the tent like a dog, on her hands and feet,
giving the alarm, but fearing to rise up lest she
should be felled down by the robbers. The servants<a name="page302" id="page302"></a><span class="pageno">[302]</span>
of the Germans hearing the squalling thought it was
Sa&iuml;d "beating his wife"&mdash;a thing common in these
countries. Dr. Barth heard all sorts of noises, but
imagined they were all from the celebration of the
wedding. It is always well to examine suspicious
circumstances. A strange camel had been seen
straying at sunset near our tent, which excited the
suspicions of myself and Dr. Barth. If we had
obeyed our presentiments, we might have discovered
the intended attack, or, at least, have made some
preparations.</p>

<p>A few robbers have often visited us before this.
When I had an interview with En-Noor I asked
for a couple of guards, but he refused them, on the
plea that they were unnecessary. Although he knew
well the country is now full of thieves, and told us
so, he never expected this audacious attack of
thirteen maharees! Soudan abounds with thieves,
and we must now always keep watch. May we,
however, in our further progress, have nothing
more to fear than petty larceny; and we shall have
reason indeed to be thankful!</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="footnote17" id="footnote17"></a><a href="#anchor17">[17]</a> It is astonishing how few of the Kailouees speak Arabic. The
few terms and expressions they are acquainted with are only those of
commerce.</p></div>

<p><i>Sept. 17th.</i>&mdash;In the morning En-Noor sent a message
that we must immediately move from our present
encampment on our sand-hills, a quarter of a mile
from the town, where we had a pleasant view of
everything in the valley and around, and come near
the people. So in the course of the day we pitched
tents close by the houses of the town. We found
that we were not so much molested by the inhabitants
(i.e. by their curiosity) as we expected.</p>

<p>I had heard in the previous evening that En-Noor,
two or three days ago, had written, by means<a name="page304" id="page304"></a><span class="pageno">[304]</span>
of one of the learned men of this place, to all the
towns and villages around him, begging the Sheikhs
and people not to offer us any molestation whilst we
were residing here, under his immediate protection,
as his guests, and as sacred persons recommended to
his care. This shows good-will in the venerable
Sultan. He sent to us this morning the result of
the Kadi's decision, respecting the robbers. This
singular question was put to the Kadi, "Whether
it was lawful to rob and murder the Christians by
night?" Answer, "No; on the contrary, the
Christians may fire on and kill the Muslim
robbers." The Sultan, it appears, attaches great
importance to this decision, and counts on it to
obtain the suffrages of all his people in our favour.</p>

<p>Such are the circumstances attending the first
visit of Christians to Aheer! I believe this attack
will do our servants good. They see now, that, by a
little resistance, the most audacious of thieves will
be put to flight. We ourselves shall also keep better
watch for the future.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>&mdash;I finished to-day a vocabulary of the
Kailouee language. I endeavour also to divert my
mind from the many causes of annoyance that now
exist, by studying the records of the Denham and
Clapperton expedition. We shall soon be amidst
the same countries that they explored, and, no
doubt, shall find that little has changed in the manners
of the people during these last thirty years.
Neither in the Desert nor in the kingdoms of Central<a name="page305" id="page305"></a><span class="pageno">[305]</span>
Africa is there any march of civilisation. All goes
on according to a certain routine established for
ages past.</p>

<p>A courier has just arrived from the new Sultan
of Aghadez, demanding the gumruk, or custom-dues,
from the caravan of Christians who have entered
Aheer. As if we had not already paid enough! After
two or three weeks of incessant solicitation, by the
way, I gave Es-Sfaxee, Yusuf, and Mahommed,
a small bottle of rum&mdash;the first, and it shall be the
last; for they got drunk and quarrelsome upon it.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>&mdash;This day I took a walk over the neighbouring
rocks, whence there is a wide view over the
whole surrounding valley. I have omitted to observe,
that at our former place of encampment were
seen many scorpions; so that here these reptiles
inhabit the open country equally with the ruins of
old houses or mosques, and such places. Under one
of my boxes was also discovered a l&ecirc;fa, the most
dangerous species of serpent in these countries.</p>

<p>It appears that most of the caravans that pass
through this country are obliged to pay a certain
gumruk to the prince of Aghadez. The relations of
the lesser Sheikhs of Aheer with the paramount
sultan are of this kind. When a sultan dies, or is
displaced, they assemble like the College of Cardinals,
or rather like the old Polish nobility, to elect
a new one. It is the law that this Sultan of Aghadez
must be a stranger. When once chosen he is
invested with something like absolute authority<a name="page306" id="page306"></a><span class="pageno">[306]</span>
throughout all Aheer, and he alone possesses the
dreaded power of "cutting off heads." En Noor
has sent this morning what is called "the present,
of salutation," which he determined to despatch to
Abd-el-Kader, the new Sultan of Aghadez, instead
of the immense gumruk demanded. The present
consists of one Egyptian mattrass; two white
turbans with red borders; a piece of white muslin
for making light turbans; two shasheeahs, or red
caps; two small gilt-framed looking-glasses; and a
few beads of glass and earthen composition; one
pound of <i>jouee</i>, or perfume for burning; a small
packet of <i>simbel</i>, an aromatic herb used for washing
the body; and two heads of white sugar. This composed
what may be called the official present for the
district of Tintalous. En-Noor added, from himself,
two camels, a piece of silk for a gown, and various
other little things.</p>

<p>Whilst these magnificences are going on, we are
enjoying the comfortable reflection that all our
losses are gains to other people, whether they be
friends or enemies.</p>

<p>I had as much trouble to satisfy the parties who
found the Arabic Bible as if I was purchasing their
own property, and not rewarding them for accidentally
finding some of my lost goods. Finally,
however, I arranged to give them two cotton-printed
handkerchiefs and a small quantity of spices. This
was more than enough. These rewards for finding
our lost property naturally impels our friendly<a name="page307" id="page307"></a><span class="pageno">[307]</span>
people, either to rob us themselves or to wish that
others may rob us, that they may have something to
gain by attempting to recover our lost things.
What we had to pay for the recovery of each of our
camels was almost as much as some of them were
worth.</p>

<p>The weather has been dry and hot for the last
few days; at noon the thermometer rose to 100&deg;
under the tent. Suddenly it became cloudy, and a
few drops of rain began to patter down. There was
every appearance of a storm, and our people began
to collect towards the tents. At this time another
courier arrived from the new Sultan, Abd-el-Kader,
of Aghadez, respecting us. His highness says:&mdash;"No
one shall hurt the Christians: no one shall lift
up a finger against them; and if they wish to come
to my city, I shall be very happy to receive them."
This courier arrived so quickly after the other, that
I suspect his highness may be spelling for a large
present; or he may have just heard of the bad
treatment we have received, and being a new man
has determined to afford us some reparation. Little
reliance, however, can be placed on these professions,
until we know something more of the character of
Abd-el-Kader. It is certainly a great disappointment
for us that we do not go to Aghadez. I am
afraid that this will be the case with many other
important cities.</p>

<p>The Es-Sfaxee wished to have a feast to celebrate
the arrival of this good news, but I cannot<a name="page308" id="page308"></a><span class="pageno">[308]</span>
join in such a demonstration. We have little cause
for rejoicing at the conduct of the people of Aheer.
En-Noor has not yet sent us a sah of ghaseb;
or a drop of samen or a sheep's head. Never did
travellers visit a country in Africa, without receiving
some mark of hospitality of this kind from the chief
or sovereign of the place.</p>

<p>In the evening a fellow came and asked us if
we could sell him a veneese (a dressing-gown) in
exchange for ghaseb. After some trouble we fixed
the bargain. Sa&iuml;d was fool enough to give him
the veneese before he brought the merchandise, the
fellow promising to bring it the next morning.
During the night he fled with his booty on the
road to Aghadez. Amankee went in pursuit of the
fugitive, seized him on the road, and brought back
the veneese: for such matters there is no one equal
to Amankee.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;Denham compares the berries of the <i>suak</i>
(suag) to cranberries. <i>Zumeeta</i> is called parched
corn; it should be parched ground corn. Gafouley
is called guinea-corn. The green herb with which
<i>bazeen</i> is generally seasoned is called <i>melocheea</i>
(ochra). There are, however, various herbs for
this seasoning, though all of them have a similar
flavour. I confess, myself, I do not much like the flavour;
it is, like that of olives, an acquired taste.
Bazeen may be called flour-pudding.</p>

<p>Gubga is a Bornouese measure, eight dr&acirc;as (or
lengths of the lower part of the arm, from the elbow<a name="page309" id="page309"></a><span class="pageno">[309]</span>
to the tips of the fingers) in length and one inch and
a half broad. Denham, who spells it gubka, says it is
about one English yard. The eight dr&acirc;as would be,
however, nearly three yards. This measure is applied
to white, coarse, native-woven cotton, and a
piece of cotton eight dr&acirc;as long and one inch and half
broad is a gubga. This is the money of Bornou;
it must be a most inconvenient currency, but habit
accustoms us to everything.</p>

<p>It is reported in town, that En-Noor intends
shortly to make a razzia on the towns where we
were plundered: he says, perhaps justly, "The
tribes have '<i>tasted</i>' fine burnouses, more especially
their sheikhs; and emboldened by their success, and
the attractiveness of the rich vestments, they will
now plunder all the caravans." This is another
reason why strong representations should be made
to the Pasha of Mourzuk to grant us redress. En-Noor
can seize camels and sequester them; he can
also seize men: but he must afterwards send them
to Aghadez for trial. This razzia, however, will not
come off yet.</p>

<p>A storm of wind, with at little rain as usual,
visited us in the afternoon. It then cleared up, and
was fine all the evening.</p>

<p>The Es-Sfaxee, heading our servants, was determined
to fire away a little gunpowder this evening
though much against my inclination. After they
had been firing near the tents, En-Noor sent for
them to fire at the doors of his house. The old<a name="page310" id="page310"></a><span class="pageno">[310]</span>
Sheikh is now waxing mighty civil, and swears that
we are his <i>walad</i> (children). We shall see what
we shall see. Yusuf even thinks he can be persuaded
to sign the treaty. All the Kailouees are
very fond of powder, and also very much alarmed at
it. They say they could themselves make plenty of
powder if saltpetre were found them.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;It appears that some of the districts of
Damerghou are included within the circle of Aheer,
and that the Kailouees exercise authority there.
En-Noor has a house there.</p>

<p>Overweg's three hypotheses of danger south of
Bornou are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To be stripped of everything by robbers, and
left naked in the wilderness.</p>

<p>2. To be devoured by wild beasts.</p>

<p>3. To be forced to traverse a desert where there
is no subsistence for man or beast. Indeed, after the
experience we have had up this road, although a
Tuarick road (and Tuaricks are not supposed to have
a peculiar antipathy to Christians), it will be next
to suicide to proceed far south without adequate
guides and protection.</p>

<p>The two predominant passions of men in all
these Tuarick countries, especially Aheer, are for
dress and women. A few only are tainted by fanaticism,
and fewer still are misers; because, probably
they have nothing to save. Of the character of the
women I cannot speak, for want of experience; the
few we have met with have begged mostly for trinkets,<a name="page311" id="page311"></a><span class="pageno">[311]</span>
and looking-glasses, but we have seen little of the
love of intrigue.</p>

<p>About Aheer, the Bornou and Soudan routes
appear not to be far apart. The Tibboos make
Kisbee to be only eight days from Aghadez. The
Kailouees also state that Bilma (or <i>Boulouma</i>, in
their pronunciation) is only seven or eight days of
good travelling from Tintalous; but the salt-caravans
always employ fourteen days, arriving at Bilma on
the fifteenth.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon a portion of a large Soudan
caravan arrived. A number of bullocks were
amongst its beasts of burden; one of these had immense
branching horns, and, according to the report
of Sa&iuml;d's wife, was of the same species as those found
in her country, Kanemboo, near Bornou. These bullocks
seemed to be in every respect trained like horses,
and some of them carry a burden of four cantars.</p>

<p><i>22d.</i>&mdash;I rose early, to prepare my despatches for
Mourzuk and England. To-day not much wind, only
a little refreshing breeze. The wind, which appears
to visit us daily instead of the rain, generally begins
about an hour after noon, and continues to blow in
fitful gusts until three or four P.M. when it gradually
sinks. The evenings are perfectly calm, though
not always cloudless.</p>

<p>Yesterday five maharees arrived from Tintaghoda,
mounted by persons who came to inquire after the
health of En-Noor. They left early this morning.
Somehow or other these maharees always look suspicious<a name="page312" id="page312"></a><span class="pageno">[312]</span>
to me. The injuries we have received make
us suspicious.</p>

<p>I ate some honey of Aheer to-day. It has a
most treacley taste, and, in truth, is not unlike treacle,
not having the delicate flavour of honey. It has
purgative qualities. They boil it on the fire, and so
spoil it.</p>

<p>I wrote to-day to Viscount Palmerston, to Mr.
Gagliuffi, and my wife, sending also specimens of
the Kailouee language, and the journal of Yusuf,
describing the route from Gh&acirc;t to Aheer&mdash;altogether
a good parcel.</p>

<p>The Arabs and Moors try to measure everything
by portions of their body. The dr&acirc;a, a measure from
the elbow to the tips of the fingers, is in universal
requisition. The fathom, signified by the arms extended
on both sides the body, is not so frequently
in use. The sun is often said to be so many fathoms
high. If we attended a little more to these natural
measures it might be well, although the human
body being so various in size we could never be
correct, and then we might lose sight of those artificial
means of measuring objects which distinguish
us from the semi-barbarian Arabs.</p>

<p>This evening I heard from Es-Sfaxee a more
favourable account of the power of En-Noor. It
would appear that En-Noor is the aged Sheikh, the
Sheikh Kebeer, of the Kailouees, whom all respect,
and to whom all look up in cases of difficulty and
distress. With En-Noor always authority remains,<a name="page313" id="page313"></a><span class="pageno">[313]</span>
whilst all the other Sheikhs are being changed&mdash;some
every year. En-Noor, nevertheless, appears
to be a great miser, continually amassing wealth in
money, merchandise, or camels. He is also reported
to have four hundred horses in Damerghou, a district
of which is subjected to him.</p>

<p>At the present time he is constantly receiving
visits from the surrounding Kubar, "great people,"
inquiring after his health, and bringing presents.
Whilst he thus amasses treasure, he feeds a number
of dependants a little above the starvation point;
and this standing army suffices for his executive.
Several of the princes of Aheer are expected to visit
the new Sultan of Aghadez, and compliment him
on his accession. The exact name of the new Sultan
is now said to be Kadaree Ben El-Bagharee.</p>

<p><i>23d.</i>&mdash;I rose early, to send off the despatches.
They are sent to Asoudee, where there is a caravan
just arrived from Kanou. Among the
persons composing it are some Mourzuk people,
who will take charge of the despatches. This caravan
stays a few days in Asoudee, when it will leave
direct for Mourzuk, and arrive at this latter city in
the course of two months and a-half.</p>

<p>I have just received an account of the route of the
salt-caravans from Tintalous to Bilma:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="">
<tr><td>From Tintalous to</td><td>Asaughar</td><td></td><td>Five days.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">"</td><td>Fakramah</td><td></td><td>One day.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">"</td><td>K&#257;w&#257;r</td><td></td><td>One day.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">"</td><td>Boulouma</td><td></td><td>One day.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><a name="page314" id="page314"></a><span class="pageno">[314]</span>The mediate time occupied is said to be between
eight and fourteen days. The three stations mentioned
between Tintalous and Bilma have wells of
water. There is also an abundance of herbage all
along the route for camels. The direction of the
route is always east, over a flat country (probably
through wadys); although, my informant adds, there
are no mountains. The salt is found in small lakes.
The people amass it with the water, and make of it
round cakes; the water runs away, and the cakes
become hard and dry. It is then packed up in
camel-loads. A large camel-load pays to the Tibboos
half a metagal, or about ninepence English
money. It is thus evident that the Tibboos do
derive a revenue from their salt, contrary to what
was stated by them to Major Denham. Since his
time, however, this people have found themselves in
a better condition to enforce this impost on the
Kailouee salt-merchants than they were formerly.</p>

<p>The caravan of Gh&acirc;t Tuaricks brought here the
news, a few days ago, that no less than four hundred
people, fractions of the tribes of the Azgher,
consisting of men, women, and children, followed
us as far as Tajetterat to see what they could get
from the Christians. When they arrived at the
wells, to their great disappointment we were gone.
Some of them were nearly naked, having only a
piece of leather round their loins. Our sending for
an escort from Mourzuk seems to have aroused the
whole country; all these poor wretches expected, at<a name="page315" id="page315"></a><span class="pageno">[315]</span>
least, a little <i>hamsa</i> from the Christians, who were
reported to have a long train of camels laden with
gold and silver, and all sorts of rich goods. I do
not doubt the correctness of this news; it is so
perfectly Targhee in its kind: but the report of sixty
maharees pursuing us from the Haghar desert was
always doubted by me.</p>

<p>There is now news of my stolen tea, and a chance
of my getting some of it back again, the robbers
confessing to their friends that they do not know
what to do with such "<i>herbage</i>," as they call it: it
is quite useless to them.</p>

<p>The Kailouees and Tuaricks generally do not
like beards, and cut off the hair of the upper lip
quite close. Indeed, wearing as they do the thilem,
the beard and the mustachios are completely
hidden. The Kailouees leave the crown of the
head, which is close shaved, as in the case of the
Mahommedans of the coast, quite bare, exposed to
the sun and weather. Around the lower part of
the head they wind a long narrow strip of black
cotton stuff (called <i>rouanee</i> in Soudanee), which is
continued round the face, upper and lower part, and
forms the thilem, only about an inch breadth of the
face being exposed or visible; that is, the portion
including the eyes and bridge of the nose. The
generality of the Kailouees wear, besides, a tobe, or
long broad cotton frock (or rather shirt, for nothing
is worn under it at the upper part of the body),
with immensely wide sleeves. Those a little better<a name="page316" id="page316"></a><span class="pageno">[316]</span>
off also wear trousers, very wide about the loins,
narrow at the legs, and drawn round the waist with
a belt. All use leather sandals, strong and thick;
some of them are prettily made. The whole of this
apparel is imported from Soudan, there being apparently
no manufactures in Aheer.</p>

<p>The arms of the men,&mdash;for all go armed with
some weapon,&mdash;are a dagger under the left arm, a
sword slung on the back, and a spear in the right
hand. The spear-shaft is wood, whilst those of the
Gh&acirc;t Tuaricks and Haghars are frequently metal,
of the same substance as the point of the weapon.
These iron spears are said to be manufactured by
the Tibboos. They are much more formidable
weapons than the spears with wooden shafts.
When mounted on their maharees, all the Kailouees
have shields made of the tanned skins of animals,
generally of the wild ox (<i>bugara wahoosh</i>). To
these arms the people in Aheer now begin to add
matchlocks, which are sent up from the coast. The
sword is not worn on the back when riding, but
hangs down on the right-hand side, sheathed in a
fantastic leather cage.</p>

<p>A few of the poorer sort of Kailouees appear
with bows and arrows. The latter they carry in
very close bundles, so well packed up that not one
can separate from the other. They told me they
were poisoned, and would not let me touch them.
Amongst the accomplishments of the Gighis and
magicians of Africa is that of poisoning arrows.<a name="page317" id="page317"></a><span class="pageno">[317]</span>
The pagan nations are generally very expert in
this</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span style="display: block; margin-left: 14em;">"dreadful art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To taint with deadly drugs the barbed dart."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The younger and more fashionable Kailouees
wear round their necks, and hanging down over their
breast, a large necklace of charms sewn in leather
bags. Some also wear a sort of cloth cap, called
bakin zakee, of a green colour, round which they
bind the turkadee, or black turban. On this cap
they also occasionally wear charms, done up in
small metal boxes. Their camels are very fantastically
dressed in leathern trappings.</p>

<p>The great men, and indeed all those that can
afford it, despise the simple Kailouee costume, and
indulge in all the rich dresses which are so much
liked by the Moors of the coast,&mdash;burnouses, shasheeahs,
turbans, veneeses, caftans, tobes of silk,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The dress of the women whom we see about is a
simple cotton tobe, covering them from neck to
heels. The colour of these tobes is generally blue-black,
dyed with indigo; some are glazed with
gum. Many, however, are white, and ornamented
in front about the neck with silken embroidery,&mdash;a
costume which gives them a very chaste and elegant
appearance. Sometimes the tobes are variegated
in colour, as are the trousers; but the sombre, or
pure white, are the most popular.<a name="page318" id="page318"></a><span class="pageno">[318]</span></p>

<p>I have set down the Kailouee names for various
articles of dress as well as weapons:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="">
<tr><td>Green cloth cap</td><td></td><td>Bakin zakee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Turban, or bandage round the head and face</td><td></td><td>Taghalmous.</td></tr>

<p>I can scarcely yet venture to pronounce an
opinion on the character of the Kailouees. They
decidedly differ from the Haghar and Azgher Tuaricks,
in being more civil and companionable. But
they seem to have acquired from Soudan the habit
of petty thieving, from which the Haghars are
especially free.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 24th.</i>&mdash;We had a good deal of wind yesterday,
but no appearance of rain. This morning was fine,
clear, and warm; but just after noon a sudden fall
of rain came, followed, within five minutes, by a
tempest of thunder, lightning, rain, and hail, which
broke immediately over our heads, and carried away
our small tents. Even my Bornou tent, having
been dried up by the recent weather, admitted the
rain, and several of our things were wetted. The
tempest itself did not last more than fifteen or
twenty minutes; and by the time the moon rose in
the evening, all clouds had cleared away, and the
heavens were as pure as in the morning. I may
observe that the rain is less disagreeable to me than<a name="page320" id="page320"></a><span class="pageno">[320]</span>
the clouds of sand-dust, with which we are at other
times persecuted. The fine particles cover and pervade
everything, and getting between the skin and
the flannel, produce an irritation like the pricking
of needles.</p>

<p>This day Yusuf brought a message from En-Noor,
to the effect that he had heard from various
people that I had brought a sword for him from
the Queen of England, and also a letter from Her
Majesty. He added: "I trust I have done nothing
to offend the Consul or his companions; and I pray
that there may be nothing between us but good
feeling and justice&mdash;no lying, nothing but truth and
fair dealing."</p>

<p>It now seemed to me that a good opportunity
had arrived for introducing the subject of the treaty;
and I determined to make an effort, being convinced,
from recent transactions between En-Noor and his
brother chieftains, that he exerts paramount influence
in Aheer; so that it may be of considerable
benefit to Christian travellers that a treaty of amity
and commerce should be signed by him. Yusuf
therefore prepared a treaty in Arabic, and I one in
English. This done, I caused En-Noor to be informed
of our intentions, and, taking with me a
sword, went to visit him with some anxiety.</p>

<p>We found the Sultan, in company with half-a-dozen
people; he received us in a very friendly
manner, and really seemed on this occasion to be
what he professes to be, the friend and Consul of<a name="page321" id="page321"></a><span class="pageno">[321]</span>
the English. I explained to him, that we certainly
had this treaty ready for him, and intended to
have presented it to him on our arrival; but on
account of our sufferings and the robberies committed
on us, and seeing the country in a state
of revolution, I had no heart to present to his
highness anything from the Queen of England.
However, now that things were more settled, and
as I saw there was authority in the country, I
had much pleasure in proposing for his signature
a treaty from my Government. At the same
moment, as an incentive, I presented the sword (a
small naval officer's sword, with a good deal of
polished brass and gilding about it, of the value, at
most, of five pounds). To my great satisfaction,
his highness accepted both treaty and present with
ardent manifestations of pleasure. He made me
read the document in English, to hear the sound of
our language; and he also desired me to leave with
him an English copy. This we did, with some explanation
of the contents in an Arabic letter on the
back. We then took our copy in Arabic. The
sword pleased him greatly, on account of its lightness,
for he is an old man, not very strong; and
because it glittered with gold. We wrote the
maker's name in Arabic, and gave directions to
have it well preserved. He inquired after Drs.
Barth and Overweg, and seemed to take great
interest in our welfare.</p>

<p>In the midst of our conversation a lady, one of<a name="page322" id="page322"></a><span class="pageno">[322]</span>
the Sultan's female relations, came, moved no doubt
by curiosity, into the room. She was evidently a
fine dame, a person of fashion in this Saharan capital.
Her countenance, in due obedience to the
requirements of <i>ton</i>, was not "<i>rouged</i> up to the
eyes," but "<i>yellowed</i> up to the eyes!" There cannot
be a more appalling custom. Imagine a young
lady, of brown-black complexion, daubed with
brilliant yellow ochre! The paint covers the whole
face, from the roots of the hair to the lower
jaw, forming two semicircles with the upper lips.
Between the eyes are three black beauty-spots, descending
perpendicularly on the bridge of the nose.
The eyebrows are blackened, and joined, so as to
form one immense arch across the face, under the
yellow brow. Is it possible to disguise the human
countenance more completely?</p>

<p>The dark-blue cotton skirt of this lady was
turned up behind over her head, so as to form a
kind of hood; but underneath she wore a coloured
petticoat. Generally, the women of Tintalous wear
a frock, or chemise, and a piece of cotton wrapper
over their head and shoulders.<a name="anchor18" id="anchor18"></a><a href="#footnote18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> This wrapper,
which serves as a shawl, is not unlike, in effect,
the black veil worn by the Maltese women. The
lady we saw at En-Noor's wore a profusion of necklaces,
armlets, and anklets of metal, wood, and horn.
She gazed about for some time and then went her
way. After asking and receiving permission to<a name="page323" id="page323"></a><span class="pageno">[323]</span>
hoist the British flag over the tents, and to fire a
salute, we imitated her example. This is my first
success in diplomacy! On returning, we prepared for
our evening's festivities, but the tempest assailing us
we waited till fairer weather.</p>

<p>At five in the evening we hoisted the British
flag, and fired no less than a hundred musket discharges.
I do not recollect that this ceremony was
ever before performed in the desert, in Bornou
or Soudan, although the union-jack certainly now
flies at Mourzuk and Ghadamez, on the roofs of
the consular houses.</p>

<p>Now I pray God that our great troubles may be
over in Aheer&mdash;little troubles we must always encounter,
and bear with fortitude. Our servants and
friends are much rejoiced at our success with En-Noor,
and they promise me farther success in Soudan
and Bornou. Alas! God alone knows what is
reserved for us; but we must not despair after these,
events of Aheer. At first all was black, without
one solitary ray of light; now, all the Sultans of
Aheer are determined they say, conjointly, to afford
us protection: whilst the people are showing themselves
more friendly every day.</p>

<p>A strange thing is a devoted slave. Zangheema
is the devoted slave of En-Noor. He is his right
hand, his man of business, his vizier, his shadow,
his second self. Alternately Zangheema attends
the marts of Mourzuk and Kanou; and, fortunately
for us, he is now going to Kanou.<a name="page324" id="page324"></a><span class="pageno">[324]</span></p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;Whilst we were occupied in drying our
clothes after the previous day's tempest, we learned
that another Sultan had put himself on the list of
beggars. His Excellency Astakeelee of Asoudee has
written a long letter to En-Noor, of which we are the
subject. The substance is that it is a sin (har&acirc;m) to
plunder us Christians. En-Noor says we must send
him some trifle as a present. There remain yet to
come Lousou and some others. I am glad we are
not expected to give much in these cases, as our
means would not allow us to do so. I sent to Astakeelee
a red cloth caftan or long loose gown, a
white turban, a fez, a small looking-glass, and a
few cloves for the Sultana, the total value about
twelve dollars.</p>

<p>Serious news has just come in from the northern
frontier. It appears that the Azgher who followed
us all the way from Aisou to Aheer, secretly
exciting the people against us, have joined
with the Kailouee borderers in an attack upon a
small Tibboo caravan. Two of the merchants have
been killed, and thirty-five slaves stolen and carried
away over the desert, in the direction of Tuat.</p>

<p>This news was brought in the afternoon by a
caravan of Fezzanees, who have arrived from Gh&acirc;t.
They declare that they buried the bodies of the
two murdered men. A servant who escaped gave
them the rest of the news. It is probable that the
Tibboos made considerable resistance on the road,
as they are brave fellows, and this resistance occasioned<a name="page325" id="page325"></a><span class="pageno">[325]</span>
their being murdered. The news has produced
great excitement.</p>

<p>The people begin to see the evil effects of countenancing
the forced exactions made upon us. This
will be an instructive lesson to the holy marabouts
of Tintaghoda, who headed the tribes of the frontier
against us unfortunate Christians.</p>

<p>When we met these very small caravans on
the road, with only two owners, three or four servants,
and some forty or fifty slaves, and all without
arms, or perhaps with only a couple of swords, I
used to wonder at their apparent security, and could
not help observing, when we were night and day
pursued by bandits, "These robbers must have an
extraordinary affection for Muslims, and be very
Deists themselves; for these few defenceless people
pass unmolested, and we are pursued continually,
although our caravan is full of arms."</p>

<p>En-Noor and the new Sultan of Aghadez have
been talking loudly of a razzia to the north; they
will now see its absolute necessity, unless the route
between Aheer and Gh&acirc;t is to be closed, except for
very large caravans.</p>

<p>The Fezzanees who left Gh&acirc;t nineteen days
after us also say that before they started the news
had arrived there that the Christians were all murdered
by the people of Janet. They add, besides,
that they met Waldee at Tajetterat, together with
the people of Janet, amounting to seventy maharees,
all encamped there. If true, probably these were<a name="page326" id="page326"></a><span class="pageno">[326]</span>
the Tuaricks, with whom we were menaced at Taghajeet.
The people of Janet were in pursuit of us.
Waldee persuaded them to retrace their steps, declaring,
which indeed was the truth, that the Christians
were by that time arrived in the country of
En-Noor, and were consequently beyond their pursuit.
The bandits hearing this, immediately returned.</p>

<p>The Fezzanees praise the exertions which Waldee
made on our behalf. Hereafter we shall be
able, if we live, to verify this intelligence. It seems
doubtful that the people of Janet should be nine
days too late for us. However, our informants
declare they gave the brigands victuals and a few
presents.</p>

<p>I suppose that the grossly-exaggerated accounts
which have been spread as to the vast sums that
Hateetah and Wataitee got from us had much to
do in getting up this fermentation in the desert of
Gh&acirc;t. We knew already that all the tribes and
sheikhs were jealous of our escort. I must renew
my application to Gagliuffi for the restitution of the
property of the British Government; if not, the
people who form the proposed razzia will divide it
amongst themselves.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;En-Noor has sent me word this morning
that I may make myself quite at home in his city,
and have nothing whatsoever to fear. Moreover,
he begs to inform me that he has sent for our lost
camels to the districts where they are supposed to<a name="page327" id="page327"></a><span class="pageno">[327]</span>
be detained, with a peremptory order, that if they
are not immediately given up they are to be seized
by force, and if not found, other camels are to be
confiscated instead of them. This may be the first
effect of the slaughter of the Tibboos. It is quite
clear, however, that En-Noor is bound in honour to
recover for us our lost beasts of burden; their
detention must otherwise disgrace his authority.</p>

<p>As soon as a Moor or an Arab gains a little
money, he begins in the first place to buy a new
wife. The merchants, especially those who traverse
the Sahara, have a wife and an establishment
at all the principal cities. When they have half-a-dozen
of these establishments they are then great
men. Es-Sfaxee has gained a little money by our
misfortunes, and he now begins to talk of buying a
young slave for a wife, and what not, to attend him
on the road. But no sailor, who sails the waters of
the world through and through, and has a lass at
every port, manages matters so well as the travelling
Moorish merchant. This Moor has his comfortable
home in every large city of the interior of
Africa, and no one inquires whether he exceeds the
number fixed by the law of the Prophet or not.
Indeed, no one knows how many wives he has, or
where they are.</p>

<p>Ferajee, of the escort, had a particular salutation,
by which he used always to address me. It continues
to be repeated by some of our people: "Othrub
Gonsul! Fire off the gun, O Consul! Othrub<a name="page328" id="page328"></a><span class="pageno">[328]</span>
Gonsul!" This salute I always heard when Ferajee
was in a good humour, and now it is used to signify
that our affairs are looking up.</p>

<p>According to a Tanelkum, Janet is entirely
peopled by Azgher or Gh&acirc;t Tuaricks, and members
of the tribe of Aheethanaran, who now live on good
terms with the Azgher. This tribe is scattered
about as far as Falezlez. It was the people of the
same tribe who formed a razzia expedition against
us. The oasis of Janet, however, is not independent.
It is subject to Shafou; but has a local government
of its own.</p>

<p>Every day brings the news of a new razzia.
This morning it is reported that some brigands of
Oulimid who inhabit a district beyond Aghadez,
came down upon the people of Aghadamou, a place
five days from Tintalous, on the route of Soudan,
destroyed their houses, and carried away a great
number of their camels. Aghadamou is represented
to be a wady, with a number of huts scattered about.
I had not heard of this place before as being on the
Soudan route.</p>

<p>In the afternoon En-Noor walked out, and came
up to me and saluted me. As I passed by his
highness I had an opportunity of noticing his dress.
He wore over the body a plain blue-checked Soudan
robe, with trousers of a similar material; on his
head was a red cap bound round with a blue-black
bandage (turkadee), in the form of a turban, but
also brought, according to the invariable custom of<a name="page329" id="page329"></a><span class="pageno">[329]</span>
the Tuaricks, over and under the eyes. His shoes
were the common Soudan sandals; and thus, with a
long wand, or a white stick, he proceeded with a
slow-measured pace through the streets of the town.
A dependant followed the Sultan at a short distance,
but the absence of an escort proclaimed how deep-rooted
was his authority.</p>

<p>To-day, for the first time, En-Noor sent to buy
something of us, viz. a loaf of white sugar. As
Overweg is going to Asoudee under the protection of
En-Noor, I gave him the loaf of sugar, and told
him to send it, on his part, as a present to the
Sheikh, and at the same time to ask him to get his
escort ready.</p>

<p>The Fezzanees call the Milky Way, which appears
at this season nearly overhead early in the
evening, "the road of the dates," it being now the
time in which the dates ripen.</p>

<p>Late in the evening a troop of twenty maharees
came riding straight up to our tents. Although
none of our people were gone to bed, although all
were up and about talking, not a single person saw
them coming but myself; and I only saw&mdash;none
of us heard, so noiselessly did they steal over the
sand. This troop merely came in to bait for the
night. They, however, brought some person with
them who is about to be married to a woman of
Tintalous.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;I rose early, having slept little on account
of noises of various sorts, which continued<a name="page330" id="page330"></a><span class="pageno">[330]</span>
all night long. First, there was a drum perpetually
beating, announcing rudely enough the approaching
nuptials; then there was a cricket singing shrill
notes at my head; and then there was the screech-owl
making the valley of Tintalous ring again with
its hideous shriek. Add to all, between the roll of
the big noisy drum, the cries and uproar of the
people. This morning there are groups of people
squatting all about. Two maharees are riding
round and round one group. Before another is a
man dancing as indelicately as a Moorish woman of
the coast.</p>

<p>News of still another razzia ushers in the day.
A small caravan, it is reported, was attacked a few
days ago, on the route between this and Zinder.
The principal merchant was killed, and all the
goods and slaves carried away. The few agents
now in Tintalous see clearly that this route will
become, for the future, safe only for large caravans.
En-Noor says of the villages which were attacked
by the tribe of Oulimid, that the people must have
been chickens not to have defended themselves;
but the fact is, the whole country is now, to a
certain extent, abandoned to the pillage of lawless
banditti.</p>

<p>In the evening the people contrived to celebrate
the preliminaries of the approaching nuptials. The
bride, I now find, is no less a personage than the
daughter of En-Noor,&mdash;a full-grown desert princess.
The Sfaxee and several other foreign merchants<a name="page331" id="page331"></a><span class="pageno">[331]</span>
fired in the evening salutes in honour of the
occasion. The drum was again kept beating all
night, accompanied again by the crickets and the
screech-owl. Oh for a quiet sleep!</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;Late in the evening another troop of
twenty maharees came to visit En-Noor, and assist
at the nuptials. They were known at some distance
by the jingling of the bells, which are always
worn on their camels on such occasions. The
drumming was kept up again the greater part of
the night, the screech-owl and crickets joining the
discord as before.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;Several of our people have recently been
unwell, Yusuf amongst the rest. They take little
care of themselves, and attribute their illness to the
ghaseb. I expect we shall have them all ill in
Soudan.</p>

<p>Early this morning I found Ibrahim, servant of
the Germans, holding in his hand and playing with
a huge scorpion, which he had caught near the
tents. He seemed to have fatigued it so much that
it could not sting. It kept, indeed, always striking
with its tail, but very feebly. Its head was not at
all prominently brought forward out of its body, and
it looked as if it had no head at all. It had ten legs.
I told Ibrahim that he was a marabout, at which
he was greatly flattered.</p>

<p>The twenty maharees have joined the nuptial
festivities this morning. A number of women are
squatting in a group on the ground, and the men<a name="page332" id="page332"></a><span class="pageno">[332]</span>
mounted on their camels are riding round and
round them, sometimes in single file, and at other
times in two's and two's. Whilst this is going on,
another mounted party gallops up one by one to the
group from a short distance. All this is done to
the sound of rude noisy drums. I have not heard
any songs, or seen any other species of music but
this drum. There are, however, several drums of
different sizes, and producing various noises. They
are made of wood and with bullocks' hide.</p>

<p>The women looloo as on the coast, and both
men and women dance; not exactly as the negroes
do, but still somewhat indelicately. Hamma, who
commanded our escort, has returned from visiting
his friends.</p>

<p>The Tanelkums report that Hamma is something
like Achilles, for he has often been wounded,
having been in many battles, but none of his wounds
have ever proved fatal, or even much incommoded
him.</p>

<p>It would seem that Tintalous, like all the Tuarick
countries, is a miserably poor place; for it is said
that none, or very few, of the people in the town
have a fire for cooking their <i>bazeen</i>, except the
great En-Noor himself. The time, however, approaches
for the departure of the caravans for Zinder,
whence they bring back a great quantity of
ghaseb and samen.</p>

<p>A Haghar, or Gh&acirc;t Tuarick, I know not which,
came into my tent this morning and behaved<a name="page333" id="page333"></a><span class="pageno">[333]</span>
insolently. Amongst other antics, he took up a
gun. I immediately wrested it out of his hands and
sent him out of the tent. Yusuf was present, but,
as usual, showed little spirit.</p>

<p>My blacks were taken aback at my treating a
Haghar in this cavalier way; but I observe that
they are now more cautious in permitting strangers
to enter my tent. The day before I turned a saucy
Kailouee out, and my servants begin to understand
that I will not be pestered more with these people,
and so they keep them off. This is my only plan,
for I have told them a hundred times not to allow
strangers to come and molest my privacy.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;The noisy drums have ceased, and most
of the Targhee visitors have departed. The people,
however, still bring news of razzias, Kailouees with
Kailouees. A messenger has returned with his
report about the boat; it is quite safe and in good
hands, at Seloufeeat.</p>

<p>A caravan arrived yesterday from Gh&acirc;t, and reports
that Wataitee had returned to that place and
brought reassuring news respecting us. Behind is
coming another caravan, in which is some Moor from
Tripoli. Probably this person will bring news or letters.
From the report of Ibrahim, the Germans' servant, it
would seem that the people of Tintalous believe that
Christians eat human beings; and further, from what
I hear, this strange prejudice possesses the minds of
the lower classes in many countries of Soudan.
Such are the opinions of the semi-barbarians of<a name="page334" id="page334"></a><span class="pageno">[334]</span>
Africa respecting us and our boasted civilisation!
There is much to be done yet in the world before
mankind know one another, and acknowledge one
another as brethren.</p>

<p>En-Noor sent word this morning that he and his
friends, the Sultans of Asoudee and Aghadez, had
combined a razzia against the people of Tidek and
Taghajeet, who had plundered us on the road; and
that fifty maharees had gone to execute their purposes.
This is the expedition which has been long
talked of: we shall see its results. Dr. Barth is
making arrangements for going to Aghadez.</p>

<p>I have prepared a draft of a treaty, which Yusuf,
who accompanies Barth, will take with him. I
have also made a selection of presents for the
Sultan of Aghadez.</p>

<p>There is now an immense movement throughout
all the Kailouee country. It is supposed that the
razzia for the west has other ulterior objects besides
merely chastising the Fadeea and people of Tidek
for plundering us. The power of En-Noor more
and more developes itself. He seems to be determined
to take every opportunity to consolidate it.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 1st.</i>&mdash;Yesterday evening I saw the first
drove of bullocks in this country; it belonged to
En-Noor. Overweg made a bet with me that En-Noor
would give us one of these animals to-day.
I took his bet of twelve small Aheer cheeses against
his six, and won; for the greedy old dog has sent
us no bullock. This morning a man offers me a<a name="page335" id="page335"></a><span class="pageno">[335]</span>
draught bullock for sale. The price demanded is
fifteen metagals of this country, two and a-half of
which are equal to a Spanish dollar. He lowered
his price to eight, and the blacks offered seven, but
eight were at last given. One of our people mounted
the naked back of the bullock, and rode him as
quietly and easily as a little pony.</p>

<h3>NOTE ON THE
TERRITORIAL DIVISION OF AHEER OR ASBEN.</h3>


<p>In the text, a list of towns and villages has
already been given. The following, obtained from
another source subsequently, is far more complete,
and probably more correct. In it the towns and
districts are all described according to their situation
from Tintalous, the point from which they are made
to radiate, both with regard to their compass direction
and distance. This account of the territorial
division of Aheer is nearly an exact translation from
an Arabic paper, drawn up by Mahommed Makhlouk,
Fighi and Secretary of the Sultan En-Noor.
I have not distinguished any of the emphatic letters,
the present transcript being enough for my purpose.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
